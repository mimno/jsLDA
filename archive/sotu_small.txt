1946_1	1946_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1946_3	1946_3	At the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general  program of the Government are actually inseparable. The president bears the  responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of  proposals on all Government activities and their financing. In formulating  policies, as in preparing budgetary estimates, the Nation and the Congress  have the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views  of the various departments and agencies to form a unified program. And that  program requires consideration in connection with the Budget, which is the  annual work program of the Government.  
1946_5	1946_5	For these reasons I have chosen to combine the customary Message on the  State of the Union with the annual Budget Message, and to include in the  Budget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress, but  also for those which I recommend for its action.  
1946_16	1946_16	"1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center  of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.  
1946_17	1946_17	"Most important of all 1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of  the organization of world peace."  
1946_18	1946_18	All those hopes, and more, were fulfilled in the year 1945. It was the  greatest year of achievement in human history. It saw the end of the  Nazi_Fascist terror in Europe, and also the end of the malignant power of  Japan. And it saw the substantial beginning of world organization for  peace. These momentous events became realities because of the steadfast  purpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom  under their flags. The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 1945 by  the United Nations.  
1946_20	1946_20	Everlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those  brave men who did not come back, who will never come back the 330,000 who  died that the Nation might live and progress. All Americans will also  remain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of  soldiers, sailors, and marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their  service. They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be forgotten  or their needs neglected.  
1946_21	1946_21	The beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and  deservedly confident. We have a record of enormous achievements as a  democratic society in solving problems and meeting opportunities as they  developed. We find ourselves possessed of immeasurable advantages vast and  varied natural resources; great plants, institutions, and other facilities;  unsurpassed technological and managerial skills; an alert, resourceful, and  able citizenry. We have in the United States Government rich resources in  information, perspective, and facilities for doing whatever may be found  necessary to do in giving support and form to the widespread and  diversified efforts of all our people.  
1946_22	1946_22	And for the immediate future the business prospects are generally so  favorable that there is danger of such feverish and opportunistic activity  that our grave postwar problems may be neglected. We need to act now with  full regard for pitfalls; we need to act with foresight and balance. We  should not be lulled by the immediate alluring prospects into forgetting  the fundamental complexity of modern affairs, the catastrophe that can come  in this complexity, or the values that can be wrested from it.  
1946_25	1946_25	Our Nation has always been a land of great opportunities for those people  of the world who sought to become part of us. Now we have become a land of  great responsibilities to all the people of all the world. We must squarely  recognize and face the fact of those responsibilities. Advances in science,  in communication, in transportation, have compressed the world into a  community. The economic and political health of each member of the world  community bears directly on the economic and political health of each other  member.  
1946_26	1946_26	The evolution of centuries has brought us to a new era in world history in  which manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and  developed in new and intricate ways.  
1946_28	1946_28	It is important that the nations come together as States in the Assembly  and in the Security Council and in the other specialized assemblies and  councils that have been and will be arranged. But this is not enough. Our  ultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and  compromise.  
1946_30	1946_30	There are many new responsibilities for us as we enter into this new  international era. The whole power and will and wisdom of our Government  and of our people should be focused to contribute to and to influence  international action. It is intricate, continuing business. Many  concessions and adjustments will be required.  
1946_32	1946_32	On the domestic scene, as well as on the international scene, we must lay a  new and better foundation for cooperation. We face a great peacetime  venture; the challenging venture of a free enterprise economy making full  and effective use of its rich resources and technical advances. This is a  venture in which business, agriculture, and labor have vastly greater  opportunities than heretofore. But they all also have vastly greater  responsibilities. We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the  simple return to "normalcy" that was tried after the last war.  
1946_35	1946_35	As we move toward one common objective there will be many and urgent  problems to meet.  
1946_36	1946_36	Industrial peace between management and labor will have to be  achieved through the process of collective bargaining with Government  assistance but not Government compulsion. This is a problem which is the  concern not only of management, labor, and the Government, but also the  concern of every one of us.  
1946_38	1946_38	Labor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities. Under our collective  bargaining system, which must become progressively more secure, labor  attains increasing political as well as economic power, and this, as with  all power, means increased responsibility.  
1946_47	1946_47	Our most immediate task toward that end is to deprive our enemies  completely and forever of their power to start another war. Of even greater  importance to the preservation of international peace is the need to  preserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it into  the ways of peace.  
1946_53	1946_53	It is encouraging to know that the common effort of the United Nations to  learn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies.  
1946_54	1946_54	When difficulties arise among us, the United States does not propose to  remove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests. Neither do we  propose, however, to ignore the ideals and vital interests of our friends.  
1946_56	1946_56	The first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in  progress in London marks the real beginning of our bold adventure toward  the preservation of world peace, to which is bound the dearest hope of  men.  
1946_72	1946_72	7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and  equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of  rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.  
1946_73	1946_73	8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations  should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the  world.  
1946_81	1946_81	On the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has  recently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan. In this pattern of  control, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has  retained primary authority and primary responsibility. It will continue to  do so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice,  choose their own form of government.  
1946_83	1946_83	At Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and  Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts  of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements  in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of  representation in the Government. That is the policy which General Marshall  is so ably executing today.  
1946_94	1946_94	In accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend_lease, except as to  continuing military lend_lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender  of Japan. The first of the lend_lease settlement agreements has been  completed with the United Kingdom. Negotiations with other lend_lease  countries are in progress. In negotiating these agreements, we intend to  seek settlements which will not encumber world trade through war debts of a  character that proved to be so detrimental to the stability of the world  economy after the last war.  
1946_97	1946_97	The view of this Government is that, in the longer run, our economic  prosperity and the prosperity of the whole world are best served by the  elimination of artificial barriers to international trade, whether in the  form of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences or commercial quotas or  embargoes or the restrictive practices of cartels.  
1946_101	1946_101	3. OCCUPIED COUNTRIES  
1946_102	1946_102	The major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE_day,  and in the Pacific since the surrender of Japan, have been those of  occupation and military government. In addition we have given much needed  aid to the peoples of the liberated countries.  
1946_105	1946_105	Improvements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for  our military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated  areas, or to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,  the responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief  supplies. The Army's responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our  zones of occupation in Germany and Austria and to two small areas in  northern Italy.  
1946_108	1946_108	For the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is being  determined. The trials now in progress in Nurnberg_and those soon to begin  in Tokyo bring before the bar of international justice those individuals  who are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six  years. We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of these  evildoers will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the  masses of our former enemies against war, militarism, aggression, and  notions of race superiority.  
1946_109	1946_109	4. DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES  
1946_120	1946_120	The War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still  will need a strength of about 2 million including officers, for the armed  forces Army, Navy, and Air. I have reviewed their estimates and believe  that the safety of the Nation will require the maintenance of an armed  strength of this size for the calendar year that is before us.  
1946_123	1946_123	I. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  
1946_125	1946_125	We know, however, that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence, in war or  in peace. We have had to fight hard to hold the line. We have made  strenuous efforts to speed reconversion. But neither the danger of a  postwar inflation nor of a subsequent collapse in production and employment  is yet overcome. We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or  pessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a  careful analysis of foreseeable trends.  
1946_127	1946_127	Civilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout  the next year. This does not mean, however, that continuing full employment  is assured. It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will  proceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities. Even  if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur,  unemployment will increase temporarily. The extent to which this  unemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial  expansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government.  
1946_135	1946_135	While we are meeting these immediate needs we must look forward to a  long_range program of security and increased standard of living.  
1946_140	1946_140	Management has a no less direct interest because on management rests the  responsibility for conducting a growing and prosperous business.  
1946_146	1946_146	Labor and management in many industries have been operating successfully  under the Government's wage_price policy. Upward revisions of wage scales  have been made in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since  VJ_day. It is estimated that about 6 million workers, or more than 20  percent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental  establishments, have received wage increases since August 18, 1945. The  amounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10  and 15 percent, but range from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent.  
1946_147	1946_147	The United States Conciliation Service since VJ_day has settled over 3,000  disputes affecting over 1,300,000 workers without a strike threat and has  assisted in settling about 1,300 disputes where strikes were threatened  which involved about 500,000 workers. Only workers directly involved, and  not those in related industries who might have been indirectly affected,  are included in these estimates.  
1946_153	1946_153	We are relying on all concerned to develop, through collective bargaining,  wage structures that are fair to labor, allow for necessary business  incentives, and conform with a policy designed to "hold the line" on  prices.  
1946_158	1946_158	There is no question in my mind that the Government, acting on behalf of  all the people, must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic  health of the Nation. There is no other agency that can. No other  organization has the scope or the authority, nor is any other agency  accountable, to all the people. This does not mean that the Government has  the sole responsibility, nor that it can do the job alone, nor that it can  do the job directly.  
1946_161	1946_161	In short, the way we handle the proper functions of government, the way we  time the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions,  has a vital bearing on the economic health of the Nation.  
1946_167	1946_167	(1) Legislation to authorize the President to create fact_finding boards  for the prevention of stoppages of work in Nationwide industries after  collective bargaining and conciliation and voluntary arbitration have  failed as recommended by me on December 3, 1945.  
1946_170	1946_170	(4) Adoption of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Act as recommended by  me on September 6, 1945.  
1946_171	1946_171	(5) Legislation substantially raising the amount of minimum wages now  provided by law as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.  
1946_173	1946_173	(7) Legislation enacting a health and medical care program as recommended  by me on November 19, 1945.  
1946_174	1946_174	(8) Legislation adopting the program of universal training as recommended  by me on October 23, 1945.  
1946_178	1946_178	(12) Legislation for the domestic use and control of atomic energy as  recommended by me on October 3, 1945.  
1946_187	1946_187	(21) Legislation for the development of the Great Lakes_St. Lawrence River  Basin_as recommended by me on October 3, 1945.  
1946_198	1946_198	I am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on  production and employment. If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and  decline to submit bids when invited as I am informed some are doing in  anticipation of higher prices which would follow the end of price controls,  we shall inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment.  On the other hand, there are the vast majority of American businessmen who  are not holding back goods, but who need certainty about the Government  pricing policy in order to fix their own long_range pricing policies.  
1946_199	1946_199	Businessmen are entitled therefore to a dear statement of the policy of the  Government on the subject. Tenants and housewives, farmers and  workers consumers in general have an equal right.  
1946_200	1946_200	We are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls just as rapidly as we  can do so. The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward  that end are a clear indication of our policy.  
1946_203	1946_203	I do not doubt that the Congress will be beset by many groups who will urge  that the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or  modified to the point where it is nearly useless. The Congress has a clear  responsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination. I  have every confidence that it will do so.  
1946_204	1946_204	I strongly urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as  possible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for  a full year from June 30, 1946.  
1946_205	1946_205	(b) Food subsidies.  
1946_207	1946_207	In anticipation of this decline in food prices, it was our belief that food  subsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months,  and eliminated almost completely by June 30 of this year. It was our  feeling that the food subsidies could be dropped without an increase to the  consumer in the present level of food prices or in the over_all cost of  living.  
1946_210	1946_210	If prices of food were allowed to increase by these amounts, I must make it  clear to the Congress that, in my opinion, it would become extremely  difficult for us to control the forces of inflation.  
1946_212	1946_212	But I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any group in the land  of the havoc which inflation can create. Certainly in the past eighteen  months there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of  the Government's price control program. I am confident that, if the facts  are placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we  are forced to choose, they will understand the reasons why subsidies must  be continued.  
1946_213	1946_213	The legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal  year should be tied down specifically to certain standards. A very proper  requirement, in my opinion, would be that subsidies be removed as soon as  it is indicated that the cost of living will decline below the present  levels.  
1946_214	1946_214	(c) Extension of War Powers Act.  
1946_223	1946_223	During the war, the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns  to make a maximum contribution to victory. The work of the Smaller War  Plants Corporation is being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan  Agency and the Department of Commerce. The fundamental approach to the job  of encouraging small concerns must be based on:  
1946_224	1946_224	1. Arrangements for making private and public financial resources available  on reasonable terms.  
1946_226	1946_226	3. Elimination of trade practices and agreements which reduce competition  and discriminate against new or small enterprises.  
1946_231	1946_231	But we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have  begun to strangle competition. We must take positive action to foster new,  expanding enterprises. By legislation and by administration we must take  specific steps to discourage the formation or the strengthening of  competition_restricting business. We must have an over_all antimonopoly  policy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising  the functions assigned to them a policy designed to encourage the  formation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises.  
1946_235	1946_235	(e) Minimum wage.  
1946_241	1946_241	Today about 20 percent of our manufacturing wage earners or about 2  million_earn less than 65 cents an hour. Because wages in most industries  have risen during the war, this is about the same as the proportion_17  percent who were earning less than 40 cents an hour in 1941.  
1946_243	1946_243	Lifting the basic minimum wage is necessary, it is justified as a matter of  simple equity to workers, and it will prove not only feasible but also  directly beneficial to the Nation's employers.  
1946_244	1946_244	(f) Agricultural programs.  
1946_247	1946_247	Farm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the  immediate future, and for at least the next 12 months they are expected to  yield a net farm income double the 1935_39 average and higher than in any  year prior to 1943.  
1946_249	1946_249	Agricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage  than actually was planted in 1945. Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate  that it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution  toward the winning of the war.  
1946_251	1946_251	For the period immediately ahead we shall still have the problem of  supplying enough food. If we are to do our part in aiding the war_stricken  and starving countries some of the food desires of our own people will not  be completely satisfied, at least until these nations have had an  opportunity to harvest another crop. During the next few months the need  for food in the world will be more serious than at any time during the war.  And, despite the large shipments we have already made, and despite what we  shall send, there remain great needs abroad.  
1946_252	1946_252	Beyond the relief feeding period, there will still be substantial foreign  outlets for our farm commodities. The chief dependence of the farmer,  however, as always, must be upon the buying power of our own people.  
1946_257	1946_257	For example, one of the best possible contributions toward building a  stronger, healthier Nation would be a permanent school_lunch program on a  scale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon. The  Congress, of course, has recognized this need for a continuing school_lunch  program and legislation to that effect has been introduced and hearings  held. The plan contemplates the attainment of this objective with a minimum  of Federal expenditures. I hope that the legislation will be enacted in  time for a permanent program to start with the beginning of the school year  next fall.  
1946_258	1946_258	We have the technical knowledge and the productive capacity to provide  plenty of good food for every man, woman, and child in the United States.  It is time we made that possibility a reality.  
1946_259	1946_259	(g) Resource development.  
1946_265	1946_265	The Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a  beneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the  sale of power be given to farmers' cooperatives and public agencies. The  public power program thus authorized must continue to be made effective by  building the necessary generating and transmission facilities to furnish  the maximum of firm power needed at the wholesale markets, which are often  distant from the dam sites.  
1946_267	1946_267	(h) Public works.  
1946_272	1946_272	The Congress has already made provision for highway programs. It is now  considering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in  several other fields, including construction of airports, hospital and  health centers, housing, water pollution control facilities, and  educational plant facilities. I hope that early action will be taken to  authorize these Federal programs.  
1946_275	1946_275	Our long_run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and  Federally assisted public works which is planned in advance and  synchronized with business conditions. In this way it can make its greatest  contribution to general economic stability.  
1946_277	1946_277	Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that housing was high  on the list of matters calling for decisive action.  
1946_280	1946_280	Since VJ_day the wartime housing shortage has been growing steadily worse  and pressure on real estate values has increased. Returning veterans often  cannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who  buy have to pay exorbitant prices. Rapid demobilization inevitably means  further overcrowding.  
1946_283	1946_283	As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that the present  dangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the Congress takes  action in the immediate future.  
1946_285	1946_285	Such measures are necessary stopgaps_but only stopgaps. This emergency  action, taken alone, is good but not enough. The housing shortage did not  start with the war or with demobilization; it began years before that and  has steadily accumulated. The speed with which the Congress establishes the  foundation for a permanent, long_range housing program will determine how  effectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent  housing and to make housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and  full employment in the years ahead. It will determine whether we move  forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward providing a  decent home for every American family.  
1946_286	1946_286	Production is the only fully effective answer. To get the wheels turning, I  have appointed an emergency housing expediter. I have approved  establishment of priorities designed to assure an ample share of scarce  materials to builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.  Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary, and  other steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck  items. I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in  facilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal  Housing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low_rent  public housing projects suspended during the war.  
1946_289	1946_289	These principles place paramount the fact that housing construction and  financing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by  private enterprise. They contemplate also that we afford governmental  encouragement to privately financed house construction for families of  moderate income, through extension of the successful system of insurance of  housing investment; that research be undertaken to develop better and  cheaper methods of building homes; that communities be assisted in  appraising their housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid,  with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and  redevelopment of slums and blighted areas with maximum use of private  capital. It is equally essential that we use public funds to assist  families of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and  that we quicken our rate of progress in rural housing.  
1946_290	1946_290	Legislation now under consideration by the Congress provides for a  comprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise, State and local  authorities, and the Federal Government. This legislation would make  permanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for  much needed technical and economic research. It would provide additional  stimulus for privately financed housing construction. This stimulus  consists of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage  large_scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers  of the Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal  savings and loan associations.  
1946_292	1946_292	Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along these lines will  not interfere with the emergency action already under way. On the contrary,  it would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency.  It would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other  American families that the American system can offer more to them than  temporary makeshifts.  
1946_294	1946_294	(j) Social security and health.  
1946_295	1946_295	Our Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth anniversary.  During the past decade this program has supported the welfare and morale of  a large part of our people by removing some of the hazards and hardships of  the aged, the unemployed, and widows and dependent children.  
1946_296	1946_296	But, looking back over 10 years' experience and ahead to the future, we  cannot fail to see defects and serious inadequacies in our system as it now  exists. Benefits are in many cases inadequate; a great many persons are  excluded from coverage; and provision has not been made for social  insurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by the  sick and the disabled.  
1946_298	1946_298	We must take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead. The  Congress for some time has been considering legislation designed to  supplement at Federal expense, during the immediate reconversion period,  compensation payments to the unemployed. Again I urge the Congress to enact  legislation liberalizing unemployment compensation benefits and extending  the coverage. Providing for the sustained consumption by the unemployed  persons and their families is more than a welfare policy; it is sound  economic policy. A sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic  ingredient of a prosperous economy.  
1946_300	1946_300	The comprehensive health program which I recommended on November 19, 1945,  will require substantial additions to the Social Security System and, in  conjunction with other changes that need to be made, will require further  consideration of the financial basis for social security. The system of  prepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to  require amounts equivalent to 4 percent of earnings up to $3,600 a year,  which is about the average of present expenditures by individuals for  medical care. The pooling of medical costs, under a plan which permits each  individual to make a free choice of doctor and hospital, would assure that  individuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are  faced with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually. In  addition, I recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings  lost through temporary sickness and permanent disability.  
1946_304	1946_304	In the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before the war.  Higher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and  for individuals to support higher and more nearly adequate expenditures for  education. But inequality among the States will still remain, and Federal  help will still be needed.  
1946_307	1946_307	(l) Federal Government personnel.  
1946_309	1946_309	At the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees, we have  shortened the workweek by one_sixth or more throughout the Government and  have restored holidays. The process of readjustment has been complicated  and costs have been increased by a heavy turn_over in the remaining  personnel particularly by the loss of some of our best administrators.  Thousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly employed in the  civil service. Many civilians have been transferred from war agencies to  their former peacetime agencies. Recruitment standards, which had to be  relaxed during the war, are now being tightened.  
1946_319	1946_319	SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET  
1946_321	1946_321	Expenditures of all kinds, authorized and recommended, in the next year are  estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars. Net receipts are estimated at  31.5 billion dollars. The estimated difference of 4.3 billion dollars will  be met by a reduction in the very substantial balance which will be in the  Treasury during the next fiscal year.  
1946_323	1946_323	To elaborate, the Budget, as I have remarked above, reflects on both sides  of the ledger the Government's program as recommended by the Executive. It  includes estimates not only of expenditures and receipts for which  legislative authority already exists, but also of expenditures and receipts  for which authorization is recommended.  
1946_331	1946_331	1940 9,252  
1946_332	1946_332	Although allowances for occupation, demobilization, and defense are  drastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947, they will still amount to 42  percent of the total Budget. The so_called "aftermath of war" expenditures  account for a further 30 percent of the total. The total of all other  programs, which was drastically cut during the war, is increasing again as  liquidation of the war program proceeds and renewed emphasis is placed on  the peacetime objectives of the Government.  
1946_334	1946_334	As a result, estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4.3  billion dollars. This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash  balance in the Treasury. Thus, after a long period of increasing public  debt resulting from depression budgets and war budgets, it is anticipated  that no increase in the Federal debt will be required next year.

1946_348	1946_348	The current fiscal year, 1946, is a year of transition. When the year  opened, in July 1945, we were still fighting a major war, and Federal  expenditures were running at an annual rate of about 100 billion dollars.  By June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half. The Budget total for  the current fiscal year is now estimated at 67.2 billion dollars, of which  more than two_thirds provides for war and war liquidation. Since net  receipts are estimated at 38.6 billion dollars, there will be an excess of  expenditures of 28.6 billion dollars for the current fiscal year.  
1946_351	1946_351	Similarly, only over_all estimates are provided for new programs  recommended in this Message; detailed recommendations will be transmitted  after authorizing legislation has been enacted. It should be recognized  that many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are  initial year figures. These figures will be affected by the date the  legislation is enacted and by the time needed for getting a program under  way. New programs, such as that for a national research agency, will  require larger amounts in later years. The estimates exclude major elements  of the proposed national health program since the greater part of these  will be covered by expenditures from trust funds.  
1946_359	1946_359	The wartime annual rate of Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32  billion dollars, while the Nation's budget total has dropped only half as  much. The drop in total value of production and services has been less  drastic because increasing private activities have absorbed in large  measure the manpower and materials released from war production and war  services.

1946_399	1946_399	In general, the drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into  lower gear; it has not thrown it out of gear. Our economic machine  demonstrates remarkable resiliency, although there are many difficulties  that must still be overcome. The rapid termination of war contracts, prompt  clearance of unneeded Government_owned equipment from private plants, and  other reconversion policies have greatly speeded up the beginning of  peacetime work in reconverted plants.  
1946_401	1946_401	The Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion  analyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials  that hamper reconversion in certain industries and proposes policies to  deal with these situations. The lack of adequate housing is one of the main  factors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities  exist.  
1946_412	1946_412	Moreover, inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful, and  ill_advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further.  
1946_413	1946_413	My decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made  in the light of existing economic conditions and prospects.

1946_427	1946_427	Although the public debt is expected to decline, a substantial volume of  refinancing will be required, because of the large volume of maturing  obligations. Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in  recent months and are expected to remain large for some time. The issuance  of savings bonds will be continued. These bonds represent a convenient  method of investment for small savers, and also an anti_inflationary method  of refinancing. Government agencies and trust funds are expected to buy  about 2.5 billion dollars of Government securities during the next 6  months, and 2.8 billion dollars more during the fiscal year 1947. Through  these and other debt operations, the distribution of the Federal debt among  the various types of public and private owners will change, even though the  total is expected to decline.  
1946_436	1946_436	(a) War expenditures.  
1946_452	1946_452	During the war, authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in  advance of obligation and spending to afford ample time for planning of  production by the procurement services and by industry. Thus our cumulative  war program authorized in the period between July 1, 1940, and July 1,  1945, was 431 billion dollars, including net war commitments of Government  corporations. Expenditures against those authorizations totaled 290 billion  dollars. This left 141 billion dollars in unobligated authorizations and  unliquidated obligations.  
1946_453	1946_453	With the end of fighting, it became necessary to adjust war authorizations  to the requirements of war liquidation and continuing national defense.  Intensive review of the war authorizations by both the executive and the  legislative branches has been continued since VJ_day. As a result, the  authorized war program is being brought more nearly into line with  expenditures.  
1946_454	1946_454	Recisions and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946. Readjusting the  war program, as the Congress well knows, is not an easy task.  Authorizations must not be too tight, lest we hamper necessary operations;  they must not be too ample, lest we lose control of spending. Last  September, I transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of  which the Congress voted H.R. 4407 to repeal 50.3 billion dollars of  appropriations and authorizations. I found it necessary to veto this bill  because it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would impair the  reemployment program. However, in order to preserve the fine work of the  Congress on the recisions, I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget  to place the exact amounts indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable reserve,  and to advise the departments and agencies accordingly. This has been  done.  
1946_455	1946_455	In accord with Public Law 132 of the Seventy_ninth Congress, I have  transmitted recommendations for additional rescissions for the current  fiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5.8 billion dollars and of  contract authorizations totaling 420 million dollars. The net reduction in  authority to obligate will be 5.0 billion dollars, because, of the  appropriations, 1.2 billion dollars will have to be restored in subsequent  years to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books.  
1946_456	1946_456	The appropriations recommended for repeal include 2,827 million dollars for  the Navy Department, 1,421 million dollars for the War Department, 850  million dollars for lend_lease, 384 million dollars for the War Shipping  Administration, and 260 million dollars for the United States Maritime  Commission. The contract authorizations proposed for repeal are for the  Maritime Commission.  
1946_459	1946_459	On the other hand, supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will  be required for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation  Administration.  
1946_460	1946_460	In the net, it is estimated that the cumulative authorized war and national  defense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.  Expenditures of 49 billion dollars during the fiscal year 1946 will have  pushed cumulative expenditures to 339 billion dollars. The unexpended  balances will be down to 28 billion dollars on June 30, 1946.  
1946_470	1946_470	"Veterans' pensions and benefits" has become one of the largest single  categories in the Federal Budget. I am recommending for this purpose total  appropriations of 4,787 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947.  Expenditures in the fiscal year are estimated, under present legislation,  at 4,208 million dollars. These expenditures will help our veterans through  their readjustment period and provide lasting care for those who were  disabled.  
1946_471	1946_471	The Congress has provided unemployment allowances for veterans during their  readjustment period. Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is  anticipated for the fiscal year 1947. In addition, readjustment allowances  for self_employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.  
1946_472	1946_472	On May 28, 1945, in asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits  for civilian unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the  immediate reconversion period, I suggested that the Congress also consider  liberalizing veterans' allowances. Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my  recommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation. I also  recommend increasing veterans' unemployment allowances from 20 dollars to  25 dollars a week. This would involve additional expenditures estimated at  approximately 220 million dollars for the fiscal year.  
1946_474	1946_474	The ultimate benefit which veterans receive from the loan guarantee  provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act depends largely on the  success of our stabilization program in restraining building costs and real  estate values. Under the revised procedure contained in recent amendments,  the administrative workload will be minimized by the almost complete  transfer of authority for approving the guarantees to private lending  agencies and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration.  This authority carries with it the responsibility for restricting the  guarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties. Costs of the program,  other than for administration, are estimated at 21 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947.  
1946_478	1946_478	(b) For interest.  
1946_482	1946_482	This category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its  "aftermath_of_war" character, and by the succeeding year will reflect  almost entirely the normal operation of loss carry_backs and current tax  collection.  
1946_486	1946_486	To provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts, I  recommend for the fiscal year 1947 appropriations of million dollars  (including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30  percent of estimated annual customs receipts) and a reappropriation of 88  million dollars of prior_year balances from customs receipts. In addition  there is a recommended authorization of 367.5 million dollars for borrowing  from the Reconstruction finance Corporation for the loan programs of the  farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration.  It is expected that the operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation will  be financed during the coming year through the 500 million dollars of  lend_lease funds which the Congress has earmarked for price support  purposes, a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the  Corporation, and the borrowing authority of the Corporation.  
1946_495	1946_495	Federal capital outlays for transportation facilities are expected to  approximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. State and local  governments may spend 400 million dollars. Private investment, over half of  it by railways, may approach 1,150 million dollars.  
1946_496	1946_496	The Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on  improvement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new  Federal_aid highways. Much needed work on airports can begin when the  Congress enacts legislation now in conference between the two Houses.  
1946_497	1946_497	The Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53  million dollars for new construction in rivers, harbors, and the Panama  Canal and 291 million dollars for highways and grade_crossing elimination,  assuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal_aid  system. Additional expenditures for highways totaling 36 million dollars  are anticipated by the forest Service, National Park Service, and the  Territory of Alaska. Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures  of 35 million dollars under existing authority. Additional Federal  expenditures exceeding 20 million dollars (to be matched by States and  municipalities) may be made during the fiscal year 1947 under the airport  legislation now in conference between the two Houses of the Congress.  
1946_499	1946_499	The estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping  Administration provide for the transition of shipping operation from a war  to a peace basis; the sale, chartering, or lay_up of much of the war_built  fleet; and for a program of ship construction of some 84 million dollars in  the fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use.  
1946_503	1946_503	The reclamation and flood control projects which I am recommending for the  fiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays of approximately 319 million  dollars as compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946. These  expenditures cover programs of the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of  Reclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture,  and the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and  Mexico. A number of these projects are multiple_purpose projects, providing  not only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood control,  but also for the production of power needed for industrial development of  the areas.  
1946_504	1946_504	Expenditures for power transmission and distribution facilities by the  Bonneville Power Administration are expected to increase from 12 million  dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal  year. In addition, the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a  new program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the  fiscal year 1947. The Rural Electrification Administration will require  expenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million  dollars; in the fiscal year 1947, at 241 million dollars.  
1946_505	1946_505	The TVA program includes completion of major multiple_purpose  projects navigation, flood control, and power facilities and additions to  chemical plants and related facilities. Expenditures for these capital  improvement programs are estimated at 30 million dollars in the fiscal year  1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.  
1946_513	1946_513	The Budget provides for continuation and desirable expansion of the  research activities that are carried on throughout the Federal  establishment and through previously authorized grants to the States.  Additional appropriations will be required for the proposed central Federal  research agency which I recommended last September 6. That agency will  coordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new  research activities wherever they are needed; it will not itself conduct  research. The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research  agency of approximately 40 million dollars for the first year.  
1946_514	1946_514	These amounts are small in relation to the important contribution they can  make to the national income, the welfare of our people, and the common  defense. Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of  research agencies to make wise use of funds. The maintenance of our  position as a nation, however, will require more emphasis on research  expenditures in the future than in the past.  
1946_515	1946_515	Educational expenditures will require a significant share of the national  income in the fiscal year 1947. State, local, and private expenditures for  the current support of elementary, secondary, and higher education are  expected to be substantially above 3 billion dollars in that year. These  nonfederal expenditures will be supplemented by Federal expenditures  estimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget. Of this amount, the  estimate for veterans' education, as previously mentioned, is 535 million  dollars. Other amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of  vocational education in public schools, 5 million dollars for the  land_grant colleges, 50 million dollars for the present school_lunch and  milk program, 1 million dollars for the Office of Education, and  approximately 13 million dollars for various other items. In view of the  major policy issues which are still under study by the Congress and the  Administration, no specific amount has been determined for the Federal  grants, previously recommended in this Message, which would assist the  States generally in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good  education.  
1946_516	1946_516	Notwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college  buildings, careful planning will be required for the expenditures to be  made under the proposed legislation to aid the States in providing  educational facilities. A major share of the grants for the first year  would be for surveys and plans.  
1946_517	1946_517	I have already outlined the broad objectives of our foreign economic  policy. In the present section I shall indicate the Federal outlays which  the execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and  1947.  
1946_518	1946_518	(a) On the termination of lend_lease, the lend_lease countries were  required to pay for goods in the lend_lease pipe line either in cash or by  borrowing from the United States or by supplying goods and services to the  United States. Credits for this purpose have already been extended to  Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium amounting to 675 million  dollars. The settlement credit of 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom  includes an amount preliminarily fixed at 118 million dollars which  represents the excess of purchases by the United Kingdom from the pipe line  over goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States  since VJ_day and the balance of various claims by one government against  the other.  
1946_532	1946_532	Other increases are for civil aeronautics promotion, the business and  manufacturing censuses, and other expanded business services of the  Department of Commerce which have been referred to above; the forest and  Soil Conservation Services and other committees of the Department of  certain conservation activities of the Department of the Interior; and the  collection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department.  
1946_533	1946_533	The necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war  and advances in the rates of pay for postal employees have increased  substantially the estimated expenditures for postal service for both the  current and the next fiscal year. It is not expected that this increase  will cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year, although  an excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are  increased further.  
1946_537	1946_537	It should be impossible for any man to contemplate without a sense of  personal humility the tremendous events of the 12 months since the last  annual Message, the great tasks that confront us, the new and huge problems  of the coming months and years. Yet these very things justify the deepest  confidence in the future of this Nation of free men and women.  
1946_539	1946_539	As printed above, references to tables appearing in the budget document  have been omitted.  
1947_6	1947_6	If in this year, and in the next, we can find the right course to take as  each issue arises, and if, in spite of all difficulties, we have the  courage and the resolution to take that course, then we shall achieve a  state of well_being for our people without precedent in history. And if we  continue to work with the other nations of the world earnestly, patiently,  and wisely, we can granting a will for peace on the part of our  neighbors_make a lasting peace for the world.  
1947_11	1947_11	As the year 1947 begins, the state of our national economy presents great  opportunities for all. We have virtually full employment. Our national  production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year  prior to the war emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than in  any peacetime year. Our food production is greater than it has ever been.  During the last 5 years our productive facilities have been expanded in  almost every field. The American standard of living is higher now than ever  before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome it will be even  higher.  
1947_17	1947_17	An important present source of danger to our economy is the possibility  that prices might be raised to such an extent that the consuming public  could not purchase the tremendous volume of goods and services which will  be produced during 1947.  
1947_18	1947_18	We all know that recent price increases have denied to many of our workers  much of the value of recent wage increases. Farmers have found that a large  part of their increased income has been absorbed by increased prices. While  some of our people have received raises in income which exceed price  increases, the great majority have not. Those persons who live on modest  fixed incomes retired persons living on pensions, for example and workers  whose incomes are relatively inflexible, such as teachers and other civil  servants have suffered hardship.  
1947_25	1947_25	Second, restriction of monopoly and unfair business practices; assistance  to small business; and the promotion of the free competitive system of  private enterprise.  
1947_26	1947_26	Third, continuation of an aggressive program of home construction.  
1947_29	1947_29	LABOR AND MANAGEMENT  
1947_31	1947_31	Despite this outbreak of economic warfare in 1946, we are today producing  goods and services in record volume. Nevertheless, it is essential to  improve the methods for reaching agreement between labor and management and  to reduce the number of strikes and lockouts.  
1947_33	1947_33	We must remember, in reviewing the record of disputes in 1946, that  management shares with labor the responsibility for failure to reach  agreements which would have averted strikes. For that reason, we must  realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved merely by laws directed  against labor unions.  
1947_35	1947_35	That is still the national policy.  
1947_36	1947_36	And it should continue to be the national policy!  
1947_39	1947_39	We should enact legislation to correct certain abuses and to provide  additional governmental assistance in bargaining. But we should also  concern ourselves with the basic causes of labor_management difficulties.  
1947_41	1947_41	Point number one is the early enactment of legislation to prevent certain  unjustifiable practices.  
1947_45	1947_45	A second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott, when used to  further jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the  National Labor Relations Act.  
1947_47	1947_47	A third practice that should be corrected is the use of economic force, by  either labor or management, to decide issues arising out of the  interpretation of existing contracts.  
1947_48	1947_48	Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be  faithfully adhered to by both parties. In the most enlightened  union_management relationships, disputes over the interpretation of  contract terms are settled peaceably by negotiation or arbitration.  Legislation should be enacted to provide machinery whereby unsettled  disputes concerning the interpretation of an existing agreement may be  referred by either party to final and binding arbitration.  
1947_49	1947_49	Point number two is the extension of facilities within the Department of  Labor for assisting collective bargaining.  
1947_51	1947_51	Point number three is the broadening of our program of social legislation  to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.  
1947_53	1947_53	Point number four is the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to  inquire into the entire field of labor_management relations.  
1947_63	1947_63	RESTRICTION Of MONOPOLY AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE  
1947_65	1947_65	During the war, this long_standing tendency toward economic concentration  was accelerated. As a consequence, we now find that to a greater extent  than ever before, whole industries are dominated by one or a few large  organizations which can restrict production in the interest of higher  profits and thus reduce employment and purchasing power.  
1947_67	1947_67	To strengthen and enforce the laws that regulate business practices is not  enough. Enforcement must be supplemented by positive measures of aid to new  enterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and credit powers  should be designed and used to promote the growth of new firms and new  industries. Assistance to small business is particularly important at this  time when thousands of veterans who are potential business and industrial  leaders are beginning their careers.  
1947_70	1947_70	The third major policy is also of great importance to the national economy:  an aggressive program to encourage housing construction. The first federal  program to relieve the veterans' housing shortage was announced in February  1946. In 1946 one million family housing units have been put under  construction and more than 665,000 units have already been completed. The  rate of expansion in construction has broken all records.  
1947_73	1947_73	FISCAL AFFAIRS  
1947_74	1947_74	The fourth major policy has to do with the balancing of the budget. In a  prosperous period such as the present one, the budget of the Federal  Government should be balanced. Prudent management of public finance  requires that we begin the process of reducing the public debt. The budget  which I shall submit to you this week has a small margin of surplus. In the  Budget Message I am making recommendations which, if accepted, will result  in a substantially larger surplus which should be applied to debt  retirement. One of these recommendations is that the Congress take early  action to continue throughout the next fiscal year the war excise tax rates  which, under the present law, will expire on June 30, 1947.  
1947_75	1947_75	Expenditures relating to the war are still high. Considerable sums are  required to alleviate world famine and suffering. Aid to veterans will  continue at peak level. The world situation is such that large military  expenditures are required. Interest on the public debt and certain other  costs are irreducible. For these reasons I have had to practice stringent  economy in preparing the budget; and I hope that the Congress will  cooperate in this program of economy.  
1947_76	1947_76	AGRICULTURE  
1947_78	1947_78	Production of food reached record heights in 1946. Much of our tremendous  grain crop can readily be sold abroad and thus will become no threat to our  domestic markets. But in the next few years American agriculture can face  the same dangers it did after World War I. In the early twenties the Nation  failed to maintain outlets for the new productive capacity of our  agricultural plant. It failed to provide means to protect the farmer while  he adjusted his acreage to peacetime demands.  
1947_79	1947_79	The result we all remember too well. Farm production stayed up while demand  and prices fell, in contrast with industry where prices stayed up and  output declined, farm surpluses piled up, and disaster followed.  
1947_81	1947_81	The purpose of these laws was to permit an orderly transition from war to  peace. The Government plan of support prices was not designed to absorb, at  great cost, the unlimited surpluses of a highly productive agriculture.  
1947_82	1947_82	We must not wait until the guarantees expire to set the stage for permanent  farm welfare.  
1947_83	1947_83	The farmer is entitled to a fair income.  
1947_91	1947_91	Exclusive of mustering_out payments and terminal leave pay, the program for  veterans of all wars is costing over seven billion dollars a  year one_fifth of our total federal budget. This is the most far_reaching  and complete veterans program ever conceived by any nation.  
1947_92	1947_92	Except for minor adjustments, I believe that our program of benefits for  veterans is now complete. In the long run, the success of the program will  not be measured by the number of veterans receiving financial aid or by the  number of dollars we spend. History will judge us not by the money we  spend, but by the further contribution we enable our veterans to make to  their country. In considering any additional legislation, that must be our  criterion.  
1947_93	1947_93	CIVIL RIGHTS  
1947_95	1947_95	The will to fight these crimes should be in the hearts of every one of us.  
1947_99	1947_99	NATURAL RESOURCES  
1947_102	1947_102	FOREIGN AFFAIRS  
1947_107	1947_107	Our policy toward the Soviet Union is guided by the same principles which  determine our policies toward all nations. We seek only to uphold the  principles of international justice which have been embodied in the Charter  of the United Nations.  
1947_113	1947_113	World economic cooperation is essential to world political cooperation. We  have made a good start on economic cooperation through the International  Bank, the International Monetary fund, and the Export_Import Bank. We must  now take other steps for the reconstruction of world trade and we should  continue to strive for an international trade system as free from  obstructions as possible.  
1947_114	1947_114	ATOMIC ENERGY  
1947_123	1947_123	The Navy is supporting the occupation troops in Europe and in the Far East.  Its fundamental mission to support our national interests wherever  required is unchanged. The Navy, including the Marine Corps, will average  571,000 officers and men during the fiscal year 1948.  
1947_128	1947_128	National security does not consist only of an army, a navy, and an air  force. It rests on a much broader basis. It depends on a sound economy of  prices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and productive  workers, on a competitive private enterprise free from monopolistic  repression, on continued industrial harmony and production, on civil  liberties and human freedoms_on all the forces which create in our men and  women a strong moral fiber and spiritual stamina.  
1948_1	1948_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Members of the 80th Congress:  
1948_3	1948_3	On this occasion, above all others, the Congress and the President should  concentrate their attention, not upon party but upon the country; not upon  things which divide us but upon those which bind us together the enduring  principles of our American system, and our common aspirations for the  future welfare and security of the people of the United States.  
1948_11	1948_11	We must devote ourselves to finding answers to these anxieties and  aspirations. We seek answers which will embody the moral and spiritual  elements of tolerance, unselfishness, and brotherhood upon which true  freedom and opportunity must rest.  
1948_13	1948_13	It was 10 years ago that the determination of dictators to wage war upon  mankind became apparent. The years that followed brought untold death and  destruction.  
1948_14	1948_14	We shared in the human suffering of the war, but we were fortunate enough  to escape most of war's destruction. We were able through these 10 years to  expand the productive strength of our farms and factories.  
1948_18	1948_18	I propose that we look ahead today toward those goals for the future which  have the greatest bearing upon the foundations of our democracy and the  happiness of our people.  
1948_21	1948_21	The United States has always had a deep concern for human rights. Religious  freedom, free speech, and freedom of thought are cherished realities in our  land. Any denial of human rights is a denial of the basic beliefs of  democracy and of our regard for the worth of each individual.  
1948_24	1948_24	We should also consider our obligation to assure the fullest possible  measure of civil rights to the people of our territories and possessions. I  believe that the time has come for Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the  Union as States.  
1948_28	1948_28	We should now extend unemployment compensation, old age benefits, and  survivors' benefits to millions who are not now protected. We should also  raise the level of benefits.  
1948_33	1948_33	Our educational systems face a financial crisis. It is deplorable that in a  Nation as rich as ours there are millions of children who do not have  adequate schoolhouses or enough teachers for a good elementary or secondary  education. If there are educational inadequacies in any State, the whole  Nation suffers. The Federal Government has a responsibility for providing  financial aid to meet this crisis.  
1948_36	1948_36	Health and education have their beginning in the home. No matter what our  hospitals or schools are like, the youth of our Nation are handicapped when  millions of them live in city slums and country shacks. Within the next  decade, we must see that every American family has a decent home. As an  immediate step we need the long_range housing program which I have  recommended on many occasions to this Congress. This should include  financial aids designed to yield more housing at lower prices. It should  provide public housing for low_income families, and vigorous development of  new techniques to lower the cost of building.  
1948_38	1948_38	We have had, and shall continue to have, a special interest in the welfare  of our veterans. Over 14 million men and women who served in the armed  forces in World War II have now returned to civilian life. Over 2 million  veterans are being helped through school. Millions have been aided while  finding jobs, and have been helped in buying homes, in obtaining medical  care, and in adjusting themselves to physical handicaps.  
1948_39	1948_39	All but a very few veterans have successfully made the transition from  military life to their home communities. The success of our veterans'  program is proved by this fact. This Nation is proud of the eagerness shown  by our veterans to become self_reliant and self_supporting citizens.  
1948_41	1948_41	The resources given by nature to this country are rich and extensive. The  material foundations of our growth and economic development are the bounty  of our fields, the wealth of our mines and forests, and the energy of our  waters. As a Nation, we are coming to appreciate more each day the dose  relationship between the conservation of these resources and the  preservation of our national strength.  
1948_42	1948_42	We are doing far less than we know how to do to make use of our resources  without destroying them. Both the public and private use of these resources  must have the primary objective of maintaining and increasing these basic  supports for an expanding future.  
1948_50	1948_50	Our fourth goal is to lift the standard of living for all our people by  strengthening our economic system and sharing more broadly among our people  the goods we produce.  
1948_51	1948_51	The amazing economic progress of the past 10 years points the way for the  next 10.  
1948_53	1948_53	Our yearly output of goods and services has increased by two_thirds.  
1948_54	1948_54	The average income of our people, measured in dollars of equal purchasing  power, has increased after taxes by more than 50 percent.  
1948_58	1948_58	To do this, agriculture, business, and labor must move forward together.  
1948_61	1948_61	To this end our farm program should enable the farmer to market his varied  crops at fair price levels and to improve his standard of living.  
1948_62	1948_62	We need to continue price supports for major farm commodities on a basis  which will afford reasonable protection against fluctuations in the levels  of production and demand. The present price support program must be  reexamined and modernized.  
1948_64	1948_64	We also need to improve the means for getting farm products into markets  and into the hands of consumers. Cooperatives which [p.6] directly or  indirectly serve this purpose must be encouraged not discouraged. The  school lunch program should be continued and adequately financed.  
1948_67	1948_67	All these are practical measures upon which we should act immediately to  enable agriculture to make its full contribution to our prosperity.  
1948_68	1948_68	We must also strengthen our economic system within the next decade by  enlarging our industrial capacity within the framework of our free  enterprise system.  
1948_70	1948_70	Growth and vitality in our economy depend on vigorous private enterprise.  Free competition is the key to industrial development, full production and  employment, fair prices, and an ever improving standard of living.  Competition is seriously limited today in many industries by the  concentration of economic power and other elements of monopoly. The  appropriation of sufficient funds to permit proper enforcement of the  present antitrust laws is essential. Beyond that we should go on to  strengthen our legislation to protect competition.  
1948_74	1948_74	In general, however, we must continue to rely on our sound system of  collective bargaining to set wage scales. Workers' incomes should increase  at a rate consistent with the maintenance of sound price, profit, and wage  relationships and with increase of productivity.  
1948_83	1948_83	We have learned that a healthy world economy is essential to world  peace that economic distress is a disease whose evil effects spread far  beyond the boundaries of the afflicted nation.  
1948_86	1948_86	We believe that the United States can be an effective force for world peace  only if it is strong. We look forward to the day when nations will decrease  their armaments. Yet so long as there remains serious opposition to the  ideals of a peaceful world, we must maintain strong armed forces.  
1948_87	1948_87	The passage of the National Security Act by the Congress at its last  session was a notable step in providing for the security of this country. A  further step which I consider of even greater importance is the early  provision for universal training. There are many elements in a balanced  national security program, all interrelated and necessary, but universal  training should be the foundation for them all. A favorable decision by the  Congress at an early date is of world importance. I am convinced that such  action is vital to the security of this Nation and to the maintenance of  its leadership.  
1948_88	1948_88	The United States is engaged today in many international activities  directed toward the creation of lasting peaceful relationships among  nations.  
1948_89	1948_89	We have been giving substantial aid to Greece and Turkey to assist those  nations in preserving their integrity against foreign pressures. Had it not  been for our aid, their situation today might well be radically different.  The continued integrity of those countries will have a powerful effect upon  other nations in the Middle East and in Europe struggling to maintain their  independence while they repair the damages of war.  
1948_92	1948_92	We are moving toward our goal of world peace in many ways. But the most  important efforts which we are now making are those which support world  economic reconstruction. We are seeking to restore the world trading system  which was shattered by the war and to remedy the economic paralysis which  grips many countries.  
1948_94	1948_94	Our present major effort toward economic reconstruction is to support the  program for recovery developed by the countries of Europe. In my recent  message to the Congress, I outlined the reasons why it is wise and  necessary for the United States to extend this support.  
1948_96	1948_96	We intend to work also with other nations in achieving world economic  recovery. We shall continue our cooperation with the nations of the Western  Hemisphere. A special program of assistance to China, to provide urgent  relief needs and to speed reconstruction, will be submitted to the  Congress.  
1948_100	1948_100	We are following a sound, constructive, and practical course in carrying  out our determination to achieve peace.  
1948_101	1948_101	We are fighting poverty, hunger, and suffering.  
1948_102	1948_102	This leads to peace not war.  
1948_109	1948_109	Worst of all, inflation holds the threat of another depression, just as we  had a depression after the unstable boom following the First World War.  
1948_112	1948_112	The events which have occurred since I presented my 10_point anti_inflation  program to the Congress in November have made it even clearer that all 10  points are essential.  
1948_113	1948_113	High prices must not be our means of rationing.  
1948_118	1948_118	Government expenditures have been and must continue to be held at the  lowest safe levels. Since V_J day Federal expenditures have been sharply  reduced. They have been cut from more than $63 billion in the fiscal year  1946 to less than $38 billion in the present fiscal year. The number of  civilian employees has been cut nearly in half from 3 3/4 million down to  2 million.  
1948_120	1948_120	Certain adjustments should be made within our existing tax structure that  will not affect total receipts, yet will adjust the tax burden so that  those least able to pay will have their burden lessened by the transfer of  a portion of it to those best able to pay.  
1948_122	1948_122	Because of this extraordinarily high level of profits, corporations can  well afford to carry a larger share of the taxload at this time.  
1949_17	1949_17	Our production is still not large enough to satisfy our demands.  
1949_18	1949_18	Our minimum wages are far too low.  
1949_20	1949_20	Our farmers still face an uncertain future. And too many of them lack the  benefits of our modern civilization.  
1949_29	1949_29	This objective cannot be attained by government alone. Indeed, the greater  part of the task must be performed by individual efforts under our system  of free enterprise. We can keep our present prosperity, and increase it,  only if free enterprise and free government work together to that end.  
1949_30	1949_30	We cannot afford to float along ceaselessly on a postwar boom until it  collapses. It is not enough merely to prepare to weather a recession if it  comes. Instead, government and business must work together constantly to  achieve more and more jobs and more and more production which mean more  and more prosperity for all the people.  
1949_31	1949_31	The business cycle is man_made; and men of good will, working together, can  smooth it out.  
1949_36	1949_36	Second, to grant authority to regulate speculation on the commodity  exchanges.  
1949_38	1949_38	Fourth, to continue the priorities and allocation authority in the field of  transportation.  
1949_43	1949_43	The Economic Report, which I shall submit to the Congress shortly, will  discuss in detail the economic background for these recommendations.  
1949_50	1949_50	If our free enterprise economy is to be strong and healthy, we must  reinvigorate the forces of competition. We must assure small business the  freedom and opportunity to grow and prosper. To this purpose, we should  strengthen our antitrust laws by closing those loopholes that permit  monopolistic mergers and consolidations.  
1949_56	1949_56	We must push forward the development of our rivers for power, irrigation,  navigation, and flood control. We should apply the lessons of our Tennessee  Valley experience to our other great river basins.  
1949_60	1949_60	The Government has still other opportunities to help raise the standard of  living of our citizens. These opportunities lie in the fields of social  security, health, education, housing, and civil rights.  
1949_61	1949_61	The present coverage of the social security laws is altogether inadequate;  the benefit payments are too low. One_third of our workers are not covered.  Those who receive old_age and survivors insurance benefits receive an  average payment of only $25 a month. Many others who cannot work because  they are physically disabled are left to the mercy of charity. We should  expand our social security program, both as to the size of the benefits and  the extent of coverage, against the economic hazards due to unemployment,  old age, sickness, and disability.  
1949_65	1949_65	The housing shortage continues to be acute. As an immediate step, the  Congress should enact the provisions for low_rent public housing, slum  clearance, farm housing, and housing research which I have repeatedly  recommended. The number of low_rent public housing units provided for in the  legislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years.  Even this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing.  
1949_68	1949_68	The authority which I have requested, to allocate materials in short supply  and to impose price ceilings on such materials, could be used, if found  necessary, to channel more materials into homes large enough for family  life at prices which wage earners can afford.  
1949_69	1949_69	The driving force behind our progress is our faith in our democratic  institutions. That faith is embodied in the promise of equal rights and  equal opportunities which the founders of our Republic proclaimed to their  countrymen and to the whole world.  
1949_74	1949_74	The heart of our foreign policy is peace. We are supporting a world  organization to keep peace and a world economic policy to create prosperity  for mankind. Our guiding star is the principle of international  cooperation. To this concept we have made a national commitment as profound  as anything in history.  
1949_77	1949_77	During the course of this session I shall have occasion to ask the Congress  to consider several measures in the field of foreign policy. At this time,  I recommend that we restore the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act to full  effectiveness, and extend it for 3 years. We should also open our doors to  displaced persons without unfair discrimination.  
1949_79	1949_79	We believe that if we hold resolutely to this course, the principle of  international cooperation will eventually command the approval even of  those nations which are now seeking to weaken or subvert it.  
1949_82	1949_82	This is the task before us.  
1949_84	1949_84	I hope for cooperation from farmers, from labor, and from business. Every  segment of our population and every individual has a right to expect from  our Government a fair deal.  
1949_87	1949_87	The people of this great country have a right to expect that the Congress  and the President will work in closest cooperation with one objective the  welfare of the people of this Nation as a whole.  
1949_89	1949_89	Now, I am confident that the Divine Power which has guided us to this time  of fateful responsibility and glorious opportunity will not desert us now.  
1950_2	1950_2	A year ago I reported to this Congress that the state of the Union was  good. I am happy to be able to report to you today that the state of the  Union continues to be good. Our Republic continues to increase in the  enjoyment of freedom within its borders, and to offer strength and  encouragement to all those who love freedom throughout the world.  
1950_6	1950_6	In our domestic affairs, we have made notable advances toward broader  opportunity and a better life for all our citizens.  
1950_9	1950_9	Today, by the grace of God, we stand a free and prosperous nation with  greater possibilities for the future than any people ever had before in the  history of the world.  
1950_15	1950_15	Among all the great changes that have occurred in the last 50 years, none  is more important than the change in the position of the United States in  world affairs. Fifty years ago we were a country devoted largely to our own  internal affairs. Our industry was growing, and we had new interests in the  Far East and in the Caribbean, but we were primarily concerned with the  development of vast areas of our own continental territory.  
1950_19	1950_19	Right here, I want to say that no one appreciates more than I the  bipartisan cooperation in foreign affairs which has been enjoyed by this  administration.  
1950_20	1950_20	Our success in working with other nations to achieve peace depends largely  on what we do at home. We must preserve our national strength. Strength is  not simply a matter of arms and force. It is a matter of economic growth,  and social health, and vigorous institutions, public and private. We can  achieve peace only if we maintain our productive energy, our democratic  institutions, and our firm belief in individual freedom.  
1950_22	1950_22	This country of ours has experienced many blessings, but none greater than  its dedication to these principles. At every point in our history, these  ideals have served to correct our failures and shortcomings, to spur us on  to greater efforts, and to keep clearly before us the primary purpose of  our existence as a nation. They have enshrined for us, a principle of  government, the moral imperative to do justice, and the divine command to  men to love one another.  
1950_23	1950_23	These principles give meaning to all that we do.  
1950_24	1950_24	In foreign policy, they mean that we can never be tolerant of oppression or  tyranny. They mean that we must throw our weight on the side of greater  freedom and a better life for all peoples. These principles confirm us in  carrying out the specific programs for peace which we have already begun.  
1950_31	1950_31	World prosperity also requires that we do all we can to expand world trade.  As a major step in this direction we should promptly join the International  Trade Organization. The purpose of this organization, which the United  States has been foremost in creating, is to establish a code of fair  practice, and an international authority for adjusting differences in  international commercial relations. It is an effort to prevent the kind of  anarchy and irresponsibility in world trade which did so much to bring  about the world depression of the 1930's. An expanding world economy  requires the improvement of living standards and the development of  resources in areas where human poverty and misery now prevail. Without such  improvement the recovery of Europe and the future of our own economy will  not be secure. I urge that the Congress adopt the legislation now before it  to provide for increasing the flow of technical assistance and capital  investment in underdeveloped regions.  
1950_32	1950_32	It is more essential now than ever, if the ideals of freedom and  representative government are to prevail in these areas, and particularly  in the Far East, that their peoples experience, in their own lives, the  benefits of scientific and economic advances. This program will require the  movement of large amounts of capital from the industrial nations, and  particularly from the United States, to productive uses in the  underdeveloped areas of the world. Recent world events make prompt action  imperative.  
1950_35	1950_35	In the world today we are confronted with the danger that the rising demand  of people everywhere for freedom and a better life may be corrupted and  betrayed by the false promises of communism. In its ruthless struggle for  power, communism seizes upon our imperfections, and takes advantage of the  delays and setbacks which the democratic nations experience in their effort  to secure a better life for their citizens. This challenge to us is more  than a military challenge. It is a challenge to the honesty of our  profession of the democratic faith; it is a challenge to the efficiency and  stability of our economic system; it is a challenge to the willingness to  work with other peoples for world peace and for world prosperity.  
1950_38	1950_38	The ideal of equal opportunity no longer means simply the opportunity which  a man has to advance beyond his fellows. Some of our citizens do achieve  greater success than others as a reward for individual merit and effort,  and this is as it should be. At the same time our country must be more than  a land of opportunity for a select few. It must be a land of opportunity  for all of us. In such a land we can grow and prosper together.  
1950_44	1950_44	No one, of course, can foretell the future exactly. However, if we assume  that we shall grow as fast in the future as we have grown in the past, we  can get a good idea of how much our country should grow in the next 50  years.  
1950_46	1950_46	These are estimates of what we can do in the future, but we can reach these  heights only if we follow the right policies. We have learned by bitter  experience that progress is not automatic that wrong policies lead to  depression and disaster. We cannot achieve these gains unless we have a  stable economy and avoid the catastrophes of boom and bust that have set us  back in the past.  
1950_50	1950_50	To avoid this danger, we must curb monopoly and provide aids to independent  business so that it may have the credit and capital to compete in a system  of free enterprise. I recommend that the Congress complete action at this  session on the pending bill to close the loopholes in the Clayton Act which  now permit monopolistic mergers. I also hope before this session is over to  transmit to the Congress a series of proposals to strengthen the  antimonopoly laws, to assist small business, and to encourage the growth of  new enterprises.  
1950_51	1950_51	In the case of labor, free collective bargaining must be protected and  encouraged. Collective bargaining is not only a fundamental economic  freedom for labor. It is also a strengthening and stabilizing influence for  our whole economy.  
1950_60	1950_60	If we are to achieve a better life for all, the natural resources of the  country must be regarded as a public trust. We must use our precious assets  of soil, water, and forest, and grassland in such a way that they become  constantly more productive and more valuable. Government investment in the  conservation and development of our resources is necessary to the future  economic expansion of the country.  
1950_61	1950_61	We need to enlarge the production and transmission of public power. That is  true not only in those regions which have already received great benefits  from Federal power projects, but also in regions such as New England where  the benefits of large_scale public power development have not yet been  experienced.  
1950_66	1950_66	To take full advantage of the increasing possibilities of nature we must  equip ourselves with increasing knowledge. Government has a responsibility  to see that our country maintains its position in the advance of science.  As a step toward this end, the Congress should complete action on the  measure to create a National Science Foundation.  
1950_67	1950_67	Another duty of the Government is to promote the economic security, the  health, and the education of its citizens. By so doing, we strengthen both  our economy and the structure of our society. In a nation as rich as ours,  all citizens should be able to live in decency and health.  
1950_70	1950_70	In the field of health there are immense opportunities to extend to more of  our people the benefits of the amazing advances in medical science. We have  made a good beginning in expanding our hospitals, but we must also go on to  remedy the shortages of doctors, nurses, and public health services, and to  establish a system of medical insurance which will enable all Americans to  afford good medical care.  
1950_71	1950_71	We must take immediate steps to strengthen our educational system. In many  parts of our country, young people are being handicapped for life because  of a poor education. The rapidly increasing number of children of school  age, coupled with the shortage of qualified teachers, makes this problem  more critical each year. I believe that the Congress should no longer delay  in providing Federal assistance to the States so that they can maintain  adequate schools.  
1950_72	1950_72	As we go forward in achieving greater economic security and greater  opportunity for all our people, we should make every effort to extend the  benefits of our democratic institutions to every citizen. The religious  ideals which we profess, and the heritage of freedom which we have received  from the past, clearly place that duty upon us. I again urge the Congress  to enact the civil rights proposals I made in February 1948. These  proposals are for the enactment of Federal statutes which will protect all  our people in the exercise of their democratic rights and their search for  economic opportunity, grant statehood to Alaska and Hawaii, provide a  greater measure of self_government for our island possessions, and accord  home rule to the District of Columbia. Some of those proposals have been  before the Congress for a long time. Those who oppose them, as well as  those who favor them, should recognize that it is the duty of the elected  representatives of the people to let these proposals come to a vote.  
1950_74	1950_74	The measures I am recommending to the Congress concerning both our foreign  and our domestic policies represent a carefully considered program to meet  our national needs. It is a program which necessarily requires large  expenditures of funds. More than 70 percent of the Government's  expenditures are required to meet the costs of past wars and to work for  world peace. This is the dominant factor in our fiscal policy. At the same  time, the Government must make substantial expenditures which are necessary  to the growth and expansion of the domestic economy.  
1950_79	1950_79	The fiscal policy I am recommending is the quickest and safest way of  achieving a balanced budget.  
1950_81	1950_81	We work for a better life for all, so that all men may put to good use the  great gifts with which they have been endowed by their Creator. We seek to  establish those material conditions of life in which, without exception,  men may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and  worship God as they see fit.  
1950_82	1950_82	These may seem simple goals, but they are not little ones. They are worth a  great deal more than all the empires and conquests of history. They are not  to be achieved by military aggression or political fanaticism. They are to  be achieved by humbler means_by hard work, by a spirit of self_restraint in  our dealings with one another, and by a deep devotion to the principles of  justice and equality.  
1951_4	1951_4	I know that the 82d Congress will meet this challenge in a way worthy of  our great heritage. I know that your debates will be earnest, responsible,  constructive, and to the point. I know that from these debates there will  come the great decisions needed to carry us forward.  
1951_7	1951_7	We will succeed, but we must all do our part. We must all act together as  citizens of this great Republic.  
1951_14	1951_14	The free nations do not have any aggressive purpose. We want only peace in  the world peace for all countries. No threat to the security of any nation  is concealed in our plans and programs.  
1951_17	1951_17	This new imperialism has powerful military forces. It is keeping millions  of men under arms. It has a large air force and a strong submarine force.  It has complete control of the men and equipment of its satellites. It has  kept its subject peoples and its economy in a state of perpetual  mobilization.  
1951_19	1951_19	The Soviet imperialists have two ways of going about their destructive  work. They use the method of subversion and internal revolution, and they  use the method of external aggression. In preparation for either of these  methods of attack, they stir up class strife and disorder. They encourage  sabotage. They put out poisonous propaganda. They deliberately try to  prevent economic improvement.  
1951_23	1951_23	The free nations believe in the dignity and the worth of man.  
1951_24	1951_24	We believe in independence for all nations.  
1951_29	1951_29	Our own national security is deeply involved with that of the other free  nations. While they need our support, we equally need theirs. Our national  safety would be gravely prejudiced if the Soviet Union were to succeed in  harnessing to its war machine the resources and the manpower of the free  nations on the borders of its empire.  
1951_31	1951_31	In such a situation, the Soviet Union could impose its demands on the  world, without resort to conflict, simply through the preponderance of its  economic and military power. The Soviet Union does not have to attack the  United States to secure domination of the world. It can achieve its ends by  isolating us and swallowing up all our allies. Therefore, even if we were  craven enough I do not believe we could be but, I say, even if we were  craven enough to abandon our ideals, it would be disastrous for us to  withdraw from the community of free nations.  
1951_32	1951_32	We are the most powerful single member of this community, and we have a  special responsibility. We must take the leadership in meeting the  challenge to freedom and in helping to protect the rights of independent  nations.  
1951_45	1951_45	To put these plans into action, we sent to Europe last week one of our  greatest military commanders, General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  
1951_51	1951_51	It is in the Far East that we have taken up arms, under the United Nations,  to preserve the principle of independence for free nations. We are fighting  to keep the forces of Communist aggression from making a slave state out of  Korea.  
1951_52	1951_52	Korea has tremendous significance for the world. It means that free  nations, acting through the United Nations, are fighting together against  aggression.  
1951_57	1951_57	The Soviet rulers have made it clear that we must have strength as well as  right on our side. If we build our strength and we are building it the  Soviet rulers may face the facts and lay aside their plans to take over the  world.  
1951_58	1951_58	That is what we hope will happen, and that is what we are trying to bring  about. That is the only realistic road to peace.  
1951_64	1951_64	In many cases, however, our stocks of weapons are low. In other cases,  those on hand are not the most modern. We have made remarkable technical  advances. We have developed new types of jet planes and powerful new tanks.  We are concentrating on producing the newest types of weapons and producing  them as fast as we can.  
1951_65	1951_65	This production drive is more selective than the one we had during World  War II, but it is just as urgent and intense. It is a big program and it is  a costly one.  
1951_66	1951_66	Let me give you two concrete examples. Our present program calls for  expanding the aircraft industry so that it will have the capacity to  produce 50,000 modern military planes a year. We are preparing the capacity  to produce 35,000 tanks a year. We are not now ordering that many planes or  that many tanks, and we hope that we never have to, but we mean to be able  to turn them out if we need them.  
1951_71	1951_71	The first part is to get our defense production going as fast as possible.  We have to convert plants and channel materials to defense production. This  means heavy cuts in civilian uses of copper, aluminum, rubber, and other  essential materials. It means shortages in various consumer goods.  
1951_74	1951_74	The Congress will need to consider legislation, at this session, affecting  all the aspects of our mobilization job. The main subjects on which  legislation will be needed are:  
1951_75	1951_75	First, appropriations for our military buildup.  
1951_81	1951_81	Seventh, housing and training of defense workers and the full use of all  our manpower resources.  
1951_83	1951_83	Ninth, aid to the States to meet the most urgent needs of our elementary  and secondary schools. Some of our plans will have to be deferred for the  time being. But we should do all we can to make sure our children are being  trained as good and useful citizens in the critical times ahead.  
1951_92	1951_92	We are building up our strength, in concert with other free nations, to  meet the danger of aggression that has been turned loose on the world. The  strength of the free nations is the world's best hope of peace.  
1951_94	1951_94	Make no mistake about my meaning. I do not ask, or expect, unanimity. I do  not ask for an end to debate. Only by debate can we arrive at decisions  which are wise, and which reflect the desires of the American people. We do  not have a dictatorship in this country, and we never will have one in this  country.  
1951_96	1951_96	Let us keep our eyes on the issues and work for the things we all believe  in.  
1951_97	1951_97	Let each of us put our country ahead of our party, and ahead of our own  personal interests.  
1951_99	1951_99	Let us all stand together as Americans. Let us stand together with all men  everywhere who believe in human liberty.  
1951_102	1951_102	This is our cause peace, freedom, justice. We will pursue this cause with  determination and humility, asking divine guidance that in all we do we may  follow the will of God.  
1952_2	1952_2	I have the honor to report to the Congress on the state of the Union.  
1952_13	1952_13	Peace depends upon the free nations sticking together, and making a  combined effort to check aggression and prevent war. In this respect, 1951  was a year of great achievement.  
1952_15	1952_15	In Indochina and Malaya, our aid has helped our allies to hold back the  Communist advance, although there are signs of further trouble in that  area.  
1952_16	1952_16	In 1951 we strengthened the chances of peace in the Pacific region by the  treaties with Japan and the defense arrangements with Australia, New  Zealand, and the Philippines.  
1952_17	1952_17	In Europe combined defense has become a reality. The free nations have  created a real fighting force. This force is not yet as strong as it needs  to be; but it is already a real obstacle to any attempt by hostile forces  to sweep across Europe to the Atlantic.  
1952_20	1952_20	At the present session of the United Nations in Paris, we, together with  the British and the French, offered a plan to reduce and control all  armaments under a foolproof inspection system. This is a concrete,  practical proposal for disarmament.  
1952_27	1952_27	This expansion will mean more jobs and higher standards of living for all  of us in the years ahead. At the present time it means greater strength for  us and for the rest of the free world in the fight for peace.  
1952_29	1952_29	The outstanding fact to note on the debit side of the ledger is that the  Soviet Union, in 1951, continued to expand its military production and  increase its already excessive military power.  
1952_30	1952_30	It is true that the Soviets have run into increasing difficulties. Their  hostile policies have awakened stern resistance among free men throughout  the world. And behind the Iron Curtain the Soviet rule of force has created  growing political and economic stresses in the satellite nations.  
1952_32	1952_32	And here at home, our defense preparations are far from complete.  
1952_36	1952_36	In the Middle East political tensions and the oil controversy in Iran are  keeping the region in a turmoil. In the Far East the dark threat of  Communist imperialism still hangs over many nations.  
1952_37	1952_37	This, very briefly, is the good side and the bad side of the picture.  
1952_40	1952_40	Our task will not be easy; but if we go at it with a will, we can look  forward to steady progress. On our side are all the great resources of  freedom the ideals of religion and democracy, the aspiration of people for  a better life, and the industrial and technical power of a free  civilization.  
1952_43	1952_43	But if there are any among us who think we ought to ease up in the fight  for peace, I want to remind them of three things just three things.  
1952_47	1952_47	This is a time for courage, not for grumbling and mumbling.  
1952_49	1952_49	The thing that is uppermost in the minds of all of us is the situation in  Korea. We must, and we will, keep up the fight there until we get the kind  of armistice that will put an end to the aggression and protect the safety  of our forces and the security of the Republic of Korea. Beyond that we  shall continue to work for a settlement in Korea that upholds the  principles of the United Nations.  
1952_51	1952_51	Meanwhile, we must continue to strengthen the forces of freedom throughout  the world.  
1952_56	1952_56	In the long run we want to see Europe freed from any dependence on our aid.  Our European allies want that just as bad as we do. The steps that are now  being taken to build European unity should help bring that about. Six  European countries are pooling their coal and steel production under the  Schuman plan. Work is going forward on the merger of European national  forces on the Continent into a single army. These great projects should  become realities in 1952.  
1952_58	1952_58	In Asia the new Communist empire is a daily threat to millions of people.  The peoples of Asia want to be free to follow their own way of life. They  want to preserve their culture and their traditions against communism, just  as much as we want to preserve ours. They are laboring under terrific  handicaps poverty, ill health, feudal systems of land ownership, and the  threat of internal subversion or external attack. We can and we must  increase our help to them.  
1952_61	1952_61	This last year we made available millions of bushels of wheat to relieve  famine in India. But far more important, in the long run, is the work  Americans are doing in India to help the Indian farmers themselves raise  more grain. With the help of our technicians, Indian farmers, using simple,  inexpensive means, have been able since 1948 to double the crops in one  area in India. One farmer there raised 63 bushels of wheat to the acre,  where 13 bushels had been the average before.  
1952_63	1952_63	My friends of the Congress, less than one_third of the expenditure for the  cost of World War II would have created the developments necessary to feed  the whole world so we wouldn't have to stomach communism. That is what we  have got to fight, and unless we fight that battle and win it, we can't win  the cold war or a hot one either.  
1952_74	1952_74	The very critical part of our defense job this year is to keep down  inflation.  
1952_77	1952_77	Congress has a tremendous responsibility in this matter. Our stabilization  law was shot full of holes at the last session. This year, it will be one  of the main tasks before the Congress to repair the damage and enact a  strong anti_inflation law.  
1952_81	1952_81	Our strength depends upon the health, the morale, the freedom of our  people. We can take on the burden of leadership in the fight for world  peace because, for nearly 20 years, the Government and the people have been  working together for the general welfare. We have given more and more of  out citizens a fair chance at decent, useful, productive lives. That is the  reason we are as strong as we are today.  
1952_82	1952_82	This Government of ours the Congress and the executive both must keep on  working to bring about a fair deal for all the American people. Some people  will say that we haven't the time or the money this year for measures for  the welfare of the people. But if we want to win the fight for peace, this  is a part of the job we cannot ignore.  
1952_84	1952_84	I believe most people in this country will agree with me on that.  
1952_87	1952_87	I think our businessmen know that scientific research and transportation  services and more steel mills and power projects are not luxuries, but  necessities to keep our business and our industry in the forefront of  industrial progress.  
1952_98	1952_98	We should also make some cost_of_living adjustments for those receiving  veterans' compensation for death or disability incurred in the service of  our country. In addition, now is the time to start a sensible program of  readjustment benefits for our veterans who have seen service since the  fighting broke out in Korea.  
1952_104	1952_104	All these measures I have been talking about measures to advance the  well_being of our people demonstrate to the world the forward movement of  our free society.  
1952_109	1952_109	I have already made some recommendations to the Congress to help accomplish  these purposes. I intend to submit further recommendations to this end. I  will welcome the wholehearted cooperation of the Congress in this effort.  
1952_112	1952_112	When you come right down to it, it is the courage and the character of our  Nation and of each one of us as individuals_that will really decide how  well we meet this challenge.  
1952_117	1952_117	We must have that same faith and vision. In the great contest in which we  are engaged today, we cannot expect to have fair weather all the way. But  it is a contest just as important for this country and for all men, as the  desperate struggle that George Washington fought through to victory.  
1953_1	1953_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Eighty_third Congress:  
1953_8	1953_8	The purpose of this message is to suggest certain lines along which our  joint efforts may immediately be directed toward realization of these four  ruling purposes.  
1953_13	1953_13	This administration has, therefore, begun the definition of a new, positive  foreign policy. This policy will be governed by certain fixed ideas. They  are these:  
1953_14	1953_14	(1) Our foreign policy must be clear, consistent, and confident. This means  that it must be the product of genuine, continuous cooperation between the  executive and the legislative branches of this Government. It must be  developed and directed in the spirit of true bipartisanship.  
1953_16	1953_16	(3) Our policy, dedicated to making the free world secure, will envision  all peaceful methods and devices except breaking faith with our friends.  We shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to  purchase fancied gain for ourselves. I shall ask the Congress at a later  date to join in an appropriate resolution making clear that this Government  recognizes no kind of commitment contained in secret understandings of the  past with foreign governments which permit this kind of enslavement.  
1953_18	1953_18	(5) Our policy will be designed to foster the advent of practical unity in  Western Europe. The nations of that region have contributed notably to the  effort of sustaining the security of the free world. From the jungles of  Indochina and Malaya to the northern shores of Europe, they have vastly  improved their defensive strength. Where called upon to do so, they have  made costly and bitter sacrifices to hold the line of freedom.  
1953_19	1953_19	But the problem of security demands closer cooperation among the nations of  Europe than has been known to date. Only a more closely integrated economic  and political system can provide the greatly increased economic strength  needed to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable living  standards.  
1953_22	1953_22	(6) Our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and  equitable world trade.  
1953_23	1953_23	A substantial beginning can and should be made by our friends themselves.  Europe, for example, is now marked by checkered areas of labor surplus and  labor shortage, of agricultural areas needing machines and industrial areas  needing food. Here and elsewhere we can hope that our friends will take the  initiative in creating broader markets and more dependable currencies, to  allow greater exchange of goods and services among themselves.  
1953_25	1953_25	This help includes:  
1953_26	1953_26	First: Revising our customs regulations to remove procedural obstacles to  profitable trade. I further recommend that the Congress take the Reciprocal  Trade Agreements Act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate  legislation. This objective must not ignore legitimate safeguarding of  domestic industries, agriculture, and labor standards. In all executive  study and recommendations on this problem labor and management and farmers  alike will be earnestly consulted.  
1953_35	1953_35	This has meant, in effect, that the United States Navy was required to  serve as a defensive arm of Communist China. Regardless of the situation in  1950, since the date of that order the Chinese Communists have invaded  Korea to attack the United Nations forces there. They have consistently  rejected the proposals of the United Nations Command for an armistice. They  recently joined with Soviet Russia in rejecting the armistice proposal  sponsored in the United Nations by the Government of India. This proposal  had been accepted by the United States and 53 other nations.  
1953_37	1953_37	I am, therefore, issuing instructions that the Seventh Fleet no longer be  employed to shield Communist China. This order implies no aggressive intent  on our part. But we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation  fighting us in Korea.  
1953_43	1953_43	We must realize clearly that size alone is not sufficient. The biggest  force is not necessarily the best and we want the best.  
1953_46	1953_46	Because of the complex technical nature of our military organization and  because of the security reasons involved, the Secretary of Defense must  take the initiative and assume the responsibility for developing plans to  give our Nation maximum safety at minimum cost. Accordingly, the new  Secretary of Defense and his civilian and military associates will, in the  future, recommend such changes in present laws affecting our defense  activities as may be necessary to clarify responsibilities and improve the  total effectiveness of our defense effort.  
1953_54	1953_54	Civil defense responsibilities primarily belong to the State and local  governments recruiting, training, and organizing volunteers to meet any  emergency. The immediate job of the Federal Government is to provide  leadership, to supply technical guidance, and to continue to strengthen its  civil defense stockpile of medical, engineering, and related supplies and  equipment. This work must go forward without lag.  
1953_55	1953_55	V.  
1953_57	1953_57	Our immediate task is to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can:  
1953_58	1953_58	(1) Reduce the planned deficits and then balance the budget, which means,  among other things, reducing Federal expenditures to the safe minimum;  
1953_61	1953_61	(4) Check the menace of inflation;  
1953_64	1953_64	It is important that all of us understand that this administration does not  and cannot begin its task with a clean slate. Much already has been written  on the record, beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend. This record  includes our inherited burden of indebtedness and obligations and  deficits.  
1953_74	1953_74	Reduction of taxes will be justified only as we show we can succeed in  bringing the budget under control. As the budget is balanced and inflation  checked, the tax burden that today stifles initiative can and must be  eased.  
1953_84	1953_84	We are, of course, living in an international situation that is neither an  emergency demanding full mobilization, nor is it peace. No one can know how  long this condition will persist. Consequently, we are forced to learn many  new things as we go along_clinging to what works, discarding what does  not.  
1953_88	1953_88	I recommend the continuance of the authority for Federal control over rents  in those communities in which serious housing shortages exist. These are  chiefly the so_called defense areas. In these and all areas the Federal  Government should withdraw from the control of rents as soon as  practicable. But before they are removed entirely, each legislature should  have full opportunity to take over, within its own State, responsibility  for this function.  
1953_89	1953_89	It would be idle to pretend that all our problems in this whole field of  prices will solve themselves by mere Federal withdrawal from direct  controls.  
1953_92	1953_92	VI.  
1953_94	1953_94	The safety of America and the trust of the people alike demand that the  personnel of the Federal Government be loyal in their motives and reliable  in the discharge of their duties. Only a combination of both loyalty and  reliability promises genuine security.  
1953_97	1953_97	I am determined to meet this responsibility of the Executive. The heads of  all executive departments and agencies have been instructed to initiate at  once effective programs of security with respect to their personnel. The  Attorney General will advise and guide the departments and agencies in the  shaping of these programs, designed at once to govern the employment of new  personnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concerning  incumbent personnel.  
1953_100	1953_100	All these measures have two clear purposes: Their first purpose is to make  certain that this Nation's security is not jeopardized by false servants.  Their second purpose is to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned  suspicion that accepts rumor and gossip as substitutes for evidence.  
1953_102	1953_102	I have already established a Committee on Government Organization. The  Committee is using as its point of departure the reports of the Hoover  Commission and subsequent studies by several independent agencies. To  achieve the greater efficiency and economy which the Committee analyses  show to be possible, I ask the Congress to extend the present Government  Reorganization Act for a period of 18 months or 2 years beyond its  expiration date of April 1, 1953.  
1953_105	1953_105	In all departments, dedication to these basic precepts of security and  efficiency, integrity, and economy can and will produce an administration  deserving of the trust the people have placed in it.  
1953_108	1953_108	Vitally important are the water and minerals, public lands and standing  timber, forage and wild_life of this country. A fast_growing population will  have vast future needs in these resources. We must more than match the  substantial achievements in the half_century since President Theodore  Roosevelt awakened the Nation to the problem of conservation.  
1953_110	1953_110	The best natural resources program for America will not result from  exclusive dependence on Federal bureaucracy. It will involve a partnership  of the States and local communities, private citizens, and the Federal  Government, all working together. This combined effort will advance the  development of the great river valleys of our Nation and the power that  they can generate. Likewise, such a partnership can be effective in the  expansion throughout the Nation of upstream storage; the sound use of  public lands; the wise conservation of minerals; and the sustained yield of  our forests.  
1953_113	1953_113	VIII.  
1953_119	1953_119	The whole complex of agricultural programs and policies will be studied by  a Special Agricultural Advisory Commission, as I know it will by  appropriate committees of the Congress. A nonpartisan group of respected  authorities in the field of agriculture has already been appointed as an  interim advisory group.  
1953_121	1953_121	IX.  
1953_123	1953_123	The truth in matters of labor policy has become obscured in controversy.  The very meaning of economic freedom as it affects labor has become  confused. This misunderstanding has provided a climate of opinion favoring  the growth of governmental paternalism in labor relations. This tendency,  if left uncorrected, could end only by producing a bureaucratic despotism.  Economic freedom is, in fact, the requisite of greater prosperity for every  American who earns his own living.  
1953_124	1953_124	In the field of labor legislation, only a law that merits the respect and  support of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wages and  of production through strikes and stoppages, and thus add to the total  economic strength of our Nation.  
1953_126	1953_126	I know that the Congress is already proceeding with renewed studies of this  subject. Meanwhile, the Department of Labor is at once beginning work to  devise further specific recommendations for your consideration.  
1953_127	1953_127	In the careful working out of legislation, I know you will give thoughtful  consideration as will we in the executive branch to the views of labor,  and of management, and of the general public. In this process, it is only  human that each of us should bring forward the arguments of self_interest.  But if all conduct their arguments in the overpowering light of national  interest which is enlightened self_interest we shall get the right  answers. I profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow  with understanding your progress in this work. The welfare of all of us is  involved.  
1953_129	1953_129	Government can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor disputes  without allowing itself to be employed as an ally of either side. Its  proper role in industrial strife is to encourage the processes of mediation  and conciliation. These processes can successfully be directed only by a  government free from the taint of any suspicion that it is partial or  punitive.  
1953_131	1953_131	X.  
1953_132	1953_132	Our civil and social rights form a central part of the heritage we are  striving to defend on all fronts and with all our strength. I believe with  all my heart that our vigilant guarding of these rights is a sacred  obligation binding upon every citizen. To be true to one's own freedom is,  in essence, to honor and respect the freedom of all others.  
1953_133	1953_133	A cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish is the equality of rights of  all citizens of every race and color and creed.  
1953_137	1953_137	I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President  to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal  Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces.  
1953_140	1953_140	There is one sphere in which civil rights are inevitably involved in  Federal legislation. This is the sphere of immigration.  
1953_141	1953_141	It is a manifest right of our Government to limit the number of immigrants  our Nation can absorb. It is also a manifest right of our Government to set  reasonable requirements on the character and the numbers of the people who  come to share our land and our freedom.  
1953_142	1953_142	It is well for us, however, to remind ourselves occasionally of an equally  manifest fact: we are one and all immigrants or sons and daughters of  immigrants.  
1953_144	1953_144	I am therefore requesting the Congress to review this legislation and to  enact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate  national interests and be faithful to our basic ideas of freedom and  fairness to all.  
1953_151	1953_151	Public interest similarly demands one prompt specific action in protection  of the general consumer. The Food and Drug Administration should be  authorized to continue its established and necessary program of factory  inspections. The invalidation of these inspections by the Supreme Court of  December 8, 1952, was based solely on the fact that the present law  contained inconsistent and unclear provisions. These must be promptly  corrected.  
1953_154	1953_154	I repeat that there are many important subjects of which I make no mention  today. Among these is our great and growing body of veterans. America has  traditionally been generous in caring for the disabled and the widow and  the orphan of the fallen. These millions remain close to all our hearts.  Proper care of our uniformed citizens and appreciation of the past service  of our veterans are part of our accepted governmental responsibilities.  
1953_161	1953_161	There is, in world affairs, a steady course to be followed between an  assertion of strength that is truculent and a confession of helplessness  that is cowardly.  
1953_162	1953_162	There is, in our affairs at home, a middle way between untrammeled freedom  of the individual and the demands for the welfare of the whole Nation. This  way must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoids neglect  of the helpless.  
1953_164	1953_164	In this spirit must we live and labor: confident of our strength,  compassionate in our heart, clear in our mind.  
1953_165	1953_165	In this spirit, let us together turn to the great tasks before us.  
1954_3	1954_3	All branches of this Government and I venture to say both of our great  parties can support the general objective of the recommendations I make  today, for that objective is the building of a stronger America. A nation  whose every citizen has good reason for bold hope; where effort is rewarded  and prosperity is shared; where freedom expands and peace is secure that  is what I mean by a stronger America.  
1954_6	1954_6	First of all we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the  distant mountains of Korea. Although they are still called from our homes  to military service, they are no longer called to the field of battle.  
1954_8	1954_8	Segregation in the armed forces and other Federal activities is on the way  out. We have also made progress toward its elimination in the District of  Columbia. These are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate  inter_racial difficulty.  
1954_9	1954_9	Some developments beyond our shores have been equally encouraging.  Communist aggression, halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indo_china the  vigorous resistance of France and the Associated States, assisted by timely  aid from our country. In West Germany, in Iran, and in other areas of the  world, heartening political victories have been won by the forces of  stability and freedom. Slowly but surely, the free world gathers strength.  Meanwhile, from behind the iron curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in  trouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is  hard.  
1954_25	1954_25	The forthcoming Budget Message will propose maintenance of the Presidential  power of transferability of all assistance funds and will ask authority to  merge these funds with the regular defense funds. It will also propose that  the Secretary of Defense have primary responsibility for the administration  of foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of  the Secretary of State.  
1954_28	1954_28	ATOMIC ENERGY PROPOSAL  
1954_29	1954_29	As we maintain our military strength during the coming year and draw closer  the bonds with our allies, we shall be in an improved position to discuss  outstanding issues with the Soviet Union. Indeed we shall be glad to do so  whenever there is a reasonable prospect of constructive results. In this  spirit the atomic energy proposals of the United States were recently  presented to the United Nations General Assembly. A truly constructive  Soviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace, and  away from the fatal road toward atomic war.  
1954_31	1954_31	Since our hope is peace, we owe ourselves and the world a candid  explanation of the military measures we are taking to make that peace  secure.  
1954_35	1954_35	Second, the usefulness of these new weapons creates new relationships  between men and materials. These new relationships permit economies in the  use of men as we build forces suited to our situation in the world today.  As will be seen from the Budget Message on January 21, the airpower of our  Navy and Air Force is receiving heavy emphasis.  
1954_37	1954_37	Fourth, our defense must rest on trained manpower and its most economical  and mobile use. A professional corps is the heart of any security  organization. It is necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve  temporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the Republic.  Pay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed forces the  necessary numbers of long_term personnel. I strongly urge, therefore, a  more generous use of other benefits important to service morale. Among  these are more adequate living quarters and family housing units and  medical care for dependents.  
1954_40	1954_40	Another part of this foundation is, of course, our continental transport  system. Some of our vital heavy materials come increasingly from Canada.  Indeed our relations with Canada, happily always close, involve more and  more the unbreakable ties of strategic interdependence. Both nations now  need the St. Lawrence Seaway for security as well as for economic reasons.  I urge the Congress promptly to approve our participation in its  construction.  
1954_44	1954_44	The international and defense policies which I have outlined will enable us  to negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course  toward a peaceful world. We now turn to matters which are normally  characterized as domestic, well realizing that what we do abroad affects  every problem at home from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind.  
1954_51	1954_51	I turn now to the second great purpose of our government: Along with the  protection of freedom, the maintenance of a strong and growing economy.  
1954_52	1954_52	The American economy is one of the wonders of the world. It undergirds our  international position, our military security, and the standard of living  of every citizen. This Administration is determined to keep our economy  strong and to keep it growing.  
1954_55	1954_55	If new conditions arise that require additional administrative or  legislative action, the Administration will still be ready. A government  always ready, as this is, to take well_timed and vigorous action, and a  business community willing, as ours is, to plan boldly and with  confidence, can between them develop a climate assuring steady economic  growth.  
1954_61	1954_61	Third, by keeping new appropriation requests below estimated revenues, we  continue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligations  incurred by the Government under past appropriations.  
1954_66	1954_66	Without attempting to summarize these manifold reforms, I can here  illustrate their tendency. For example, we propose more liberal tax  treatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with  dependent children, and for medical expenses. For the business that wants  to expand or modernize its plant, we propose liberalized tax treatment of  depreciation, research and development expenses, and retained earnings.  
1954_71	1954_71	Agricultural laws now in effect successfully accomplished their wartime  purpose of encouraging maximum production of many crops. Today, production  of these crops at such levels far exceeds present demand. Yet the laws  encouraging such production are still in effect. The storage facilities of  the Commodity Credit Corporation bulge with surplus stocks of dairy  products, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain vegetable oils; and the  Corporation's presently authorized borrowing authority $6,750,000,000 is  nearly exhausted. Some products, priced out of domestic markets, and  others, priced out of world markets, have piled up in government hands. In  a world in which millions of people are hungry, destruction of food would,  of course, be unconscionable. Yet surplus stocks continue to threaten the  market and in spite of the acreage controls authorized by present law,  surpluses will continue to accumulate.  
1954_79	1954_79	All Federal conservation and resource development projects are being  reappraised. Sound projects now under way will be continued. New projects  in which the Federal Government has a part must be economically sound, with  local sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible. In the next fiscal  year work will be started on twenty_three projects that meet these  standards. The Federal Government will continue to construct and operate  economically sound flood control, power, irrigation and water supply  projects wherever these projects are beyond the capacity of local  initiative, public or private, and consistent with the needs of the whole  Nation.  
1954_82	1954_82	A uniform and consistent water resources policy;  
1954_84	1954_84	A sound program for safeguarding the domestic production of critical and  strategic metals and minerals.  
1954_85	1954_85	In addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forests,  parks, monuments and other natural and historic sites, as well as our  fishery and wildlife resources. I hope that pending legislation to improve  the conservation and management of publicly_owned grazing lands in national  forests will soon be approved by the Congress.  
1954_86	1954_86	NATIONAL HIGHWAYS  
1954_91	1954_91	III. HUMAN PROBLEMS  
1954_95	1954_95	Protection against the hazards of temporary unemployment should be extended  to some 6 1/2 millions of workers, including civilian Federal workers, who  now lack this safeguard. Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is making  available to the states studies and recommendations in the fields of weekly  benefits, periods of protection and extension of coverage. The Economic  Report will consider the related matter of minimum wages and their coverage.  
1954_96	1954_96	The Labor Management Relations Act of 3947 is basically a sound law.  However, six years of experience have revealed that in some respects it can  be improved. On January 11, I shall forward to the Congress suggestions for  changes designed to reinforce the basic objectives of the Act.  
1954_102	1954_102	The Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with  such mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to  help the states in their health and rehabilitation programs. The present  Hospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist  in the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to  encourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation  facilities, and nursing homes. The war on disease also needs a better  working relationship between Government and private initiative. Private and  non_profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field,  soundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their  various communities.  
1954_106	1954_106	The preparation of teachers as, indeed, the control and direction of public  education policy, is a state and local responsibility. However, the Federal  Government should stand ready to assist states which demonstrably cannot  provide sufficient school buildings. In order to appraise the needs, I hope  that this year a conference on education will be held in each state,  culminating in a national conference. From these conferences on education,  every level of government from the Federal Government to each local school  board should gain the information with which to attack this serious  problem.  
1954_112	1954_112	Extension of the advantages of insured lending to private credit engaged in  this task of rehabilitating obsolete neighborhoods;  
1954_113	1954_113	Insurance of long_term, mortgage loans, with small down payment for  low_income families; and, until alternative programs prove more effective,  
1954_114	1954_114	Continuation of the public housing program adopted in the Housing Act of  1949.  
1954_116	1954_116	VETERANS ADMINISTRATION  
1954_118	1954_118	SUFFRAGE  
1954_119	1954_119	My few remaining recommendations all relate to a basic right of our  citizens that of being represented in the decisions of the government.  
1954_121	1954_121	In the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national  suffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local  self_government to the Nation's Capital. I urge the Congress to move  promptly in this direction and also to revise District revenue measures to  provide needed public works improvements.  
1954_125	1954_125	I want to add one final word about the general purport of these many  recommendations.  
1954_128	1954_128	A government can sincerely strive for peace, as ours is striving, and ask  its people to make sacrifices for the sake of peace. But no government can  place peace in the hearts of foreign rulers. It is our duty then to  ourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those  ways spiritual, economic, military that will give us maximum safety  against the possibility of aggressive action by others.  
1954_129	1954_129	No government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that  plagues our age. Happily, our people, though blessed with more material  goods than any people in history, have always reserved their first  allegiance to the kingdom of the spirit, which is the true source of that  freedom we value above all material things.  
1954_131	1954_131	The Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 100, p. 62).  
1955_2	1955_2	First, I extend cordial greetings to the 84th Congress. We shall have much  to do together; I am sure that we shall get it done and, that we shall do  it in harmony and good will.  
1955_3	1955_3	At the outset, I believe it would be well to remind ourselves of this great  fundamental in our national life: our common belief that every human being  is divinely endowed with dignity and worth and inalienable rights. This  faith, with its corollary that to grow and flourish people must be  free shapes the interests and aspirations of every American.  
1955_6	1955_6	Second, to help keep our economy vigorous and expanding, thus sustaining  our international strength and assuring better jobs, better living, better  opportunities for every citizen;  
1955_9	1955_9	It is of the utmost importance, that each of us understand the true nature  of the struggle now taking place in the world.  
1955_12	1955_12	In the past year, there has been progress justifying hope, both for  continuing peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the  world. Free nations are collectively stronger than at any time in recent  years.  
1955_13	1955_13	Just as nations of this Hemisphere, in the historic Caracas and Rio  conferences, have closed ranks against imperialistic Communism and  strengthened their economic ties, so free nations elsewhere have forged new  bonds of unity.  
1955_14	1955_14	Recent agreements between Turkey and Pakistan have laid a foundation for  increased strength in the Middle East. With our understanding support,  Egypt and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, Britain and Iran have resolved  dangerous differences. The security of the Mediterranean has been enhanced  by an alliance among Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia. Agreements in Western  Europe have paved the way for unity to replace past divisions which have  undermined Europe's economic and military vitality. The defense of the West  appears likely at last to include a free, democratic Germany participating  as an equal in the councils of NATO.  
1955_15	1955_15	In Asia and the Pacific, the pending Manila Pact supplements our treaties  with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Korea and Japan and our  prospective treaty with the Republic of China. These pacts stand as solemn  warning that future military aggression and subversion against the free  nations of Asia will meet united response. The Pacific Charter, also  adopted at Manila, is a milestone in the development of human freedom and  self_government in the Pacific area.  
1955_18	1955_18	These developments are heartening indeed, and we are hopeful of continuing  progress. But sobering problems remain.  
1955_20	1955_20	To protect our nations and our peoples from the catastrophe of a nuclear  holocaust, free nations must maintain countervailing military power to  persuade the Communists of the futility of seeking their ends through  aggression. If Communist rulers understand that America's response to  aggression will be swift and decisive that never shall we buy peace at the  expense of honor or faith they will be powerfully deterred from launching  a military venture engulfing their own peoples and many others in disaster.  This, of course, is merely world stalemate. But in this stalemate each of  us may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for  enduring peace.  
1955_22	1955_22	In such a world, America's course is dear:  
1955_23	1955_23	We must tirelessly labor to make the peace more just and durable.  
1955_26	1955_26	We must also encourage the efforts being made in the United Nations to  limit armaments and to harness the atom to peaceful rise.  
1955_27	1955_27	We must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly  nations whose own best efforts are still insufficient to provide the  strength essential to the security of the free world.  
1955_28	1955_28	We must be willing to use the processes of negotiation whenever they will  advance the cause of just and secure peace to which the United States and  other free nations are dedicated.  
1955_30	1955_30	We must also carry forward our educational exchange program. This sharing  of knowledge and experience between our citizens and those of free  countries is a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true  partnership among free peoples.  
1955_31	1955_31	To advance these many efforts, the Congress must act in this session on  appropriations, legislation, and treaties. Today I shall mention especially  our foreign economic and military programs.  
1955_39	1955_39	Third, to keep our armed forces abreast of the advances of science, our  military planning must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapons and  techniques which flow ever more speedily from our research and development  programs. The forthcoming military budget therefore emphasizes modern  airpower in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and increases the emphasis  on new weapons, especially those of rapid and destructive striking power.  It assures the maintenance of effective, retaliatory force as the principal  deterrent to overt aggression. It accelerates the continental defense  program and the build_up of ready military reserve forces. It continues a  vigorous program of stockpiling strategic and critical materials and  strengthening our mobilization base. The budget also contemplates the  strategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain  forces. It provides for reduction of forces in certain categories and their  expansion in others, to fit them to the military realities of our time.  These emphases in our defense planning have been made at my personal  direction after long and thoughtful study. In my judgment, they will give  our nation a defense accurately adjusted to the national need.  
1955_41	1955_41	And fifth, in the administration of these costly programs, we must demand  the utmost in efficiency and ingenuity. We must assure our people not only  of adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carried forward  from year to year until the threat of aggression has disappeared.  
1955_43	1955_43	The first concerns the selective service act which expires next June 30th.  For the foreseeable future, our standing forces must remain much larger  than voluntary methods can sustain. We must, therefore, extend the  statutory authority to induct men for two years of military service.  
1955_46	1955_46	Maintenance of an effective defense requires continuance of our aggressive  attack on subversion at home. In this effort we have, in the past two  years, made excellent progress. FBI investigations have been powerfully  reinforced by a new Internal Security Division in the Department of  Justice; the security activities of the Immigration and Naturalization  Service have been revitalized; an improved and strengthened security system  is in effect throughout the government; the Department of Justice and the  FBI have been armed with effective new legal weapons forged by the 83rd  Congress.  
1955_47	1955_47	We shall continue to ferret out and to destroy Communist subversion.  
1955_48	1955_48	We shall, in the process, carefully preserve our traditions and the basic  rights of our citizens.  
1955_49	1955_49	Our civil defense program is also a key element in the protection of our  country. We are developing cooperative methods with State Governors,  Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups, as well as among Federal agencies, in  building the civil defense organization. Its significance in time of war is  obvious; its swift assistance in disaster areas last year proved its  importance in time of peace.  
1955_51	1955_51	At this time the executive and legislative branches are under the  management of different political parties. This fact places both parties on  trial before the American people.  
1955_54	1955_54	In all areas basic to the strength of America, there will be to the extent  I can insure them cooperative, constructive relations between the  Executive and Legislative Branches of this government. Let the general good  be our yardstick on every great issue of our time.  
1955_55	1955_55	Our efforts to defend our freedom and to secure a just peace are, of  course, inseparable from the second great purpose of our government: to  help maintain a strong, growing economy an economy vigorous and free, in  which there are ever_increasing opportunities, just rewards for effort, and  a stable prosperity that is widely shared.  
1955_58	1955_58	So, today, the transition to a peacetime economy is largely behind us.  
1955_59	1955_59	The economic outlook is good.  
1955_60	1955_60	The many promising factors I have mentioned do not guarantee sustained  economic expansion; however, they do give us a strong position from which  to carry forward our economic growth. If we as a people act wisely, within  ten years our annual national output can rise from its present level of  about $360 billion to $500 billion, measured in dollars of stable buying  power.  
1955_63	1955_63	Last year we had a large tax cut and, for the first time in seventy_five  years a basic revision of Federal tax laws. It is now clear that defense  and other essential government costs must remain at a level precluding  further tax reductions this year. Although excise and corporation income  taxes must, therefore, be continued at their present rates, further tax  cuts will be possible when justified by lower expenditures and by revenue  increases arising from the nation's economic growth. I am hopeful that such  reductions can be made next year.  
1955_68	1955_68	In addition, the 1956 budget will recommend appropriations to start six new  reclamation and more than thirty new Corps of Engineers projects of varying  size. Going projects and investigations of potential new resource  developments will be continued.  
1955_70	1955_70	In the interest of their proper conservation, development and use,  continued vigilance will be maintained over our fisheries, wildlife  resources, the national parks and forests, and the public lands; and we  shall continue to encourage an orderly development of the nation's mineral  resources.  
1955_74	1955_74	The Council of Economic Advisers, through its public works planning  section, has made important advances during the past year in effecting this  coordination and cooperation. In view of the success of these initial  efforts, and to give more emphasis and continuity to this essential  coordination, I shall request the Congress to appropriate funds for the  support of an Office of Coordinator of Public Works in the Executive Office  of the President.  
1955_77	1955_77	Thus, farm production is gradually adjusting to markets, markets are being  expanded, and stocks are moving into use. We can now look forward to an  easing of the influences depressing farm prices, to reduced government  expenditures for purchase of surplus products, and to less Federal  intrusion into the lives and plans of our farm people. Agricultural  programs have been redirected toward better balance, greater stability and  sustained prosperity. We are headed in the right direction. I urgently  recommend to the Congress that we continue resolutely on this road.  
1955_78	1955_78	Greater attention must be directed to the needs of low_income farm  families. Twenty_eight per cent of our farm_operator families have net cash  incomes of less than $1,000 per year. Last year, at my request, careful  studies were made of the problems of these farm people. I shall later  submit recommendations designed to assure the steady alleviation of their  most pressing concerns.  
1955_79	1955_79	Because drought also remains a serious agricultural problem, I shall  recommend legislation to strengthen Federal disaster assistance programs.  This legislation will prescribe an improved appraisal of need, better  adjustment of the various programs to local conditions, and a more  equitable sharing of costs between the States and the Federal Government.  
1955_81	1955_81	We come now to the third great purpose of our government_its concern for  the health, productivity and well_being of all our people.  
1955_84	1955_84	During the past two years, notable advances were made in these functions of  government. Protection of old_age and survivors' insurance was extended to  an additional ten million of our people, and the benefits were  substantially increased. Legislation was enacted to provide unemployment  insurance protection to some four million additional Americans.  Stabilization of living costs and the halting of inflation protected the  value of pensions and savings. A broad program now helps to bring good  homes within the reach of the great majority of our people. With the  States, we are providing rehabilitation facilities and more clinics,  hospitals, and nursing homes for patients with chronic illnesses. Also with  the States, we have begun a great and fruitful expansion in the restoration  of disabled persons to employment and useful lives. In the areas of Federal  responsibility, we have made historic progress in eliminating from among  our people demeaning practices based on race or color.  
1955_86	1955_86	As part of our efforts to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for  low_income families, we must carry forward the housing program authorized  during the 83rd Congress. We must also authorize contracts for a firm  program of 35,000 additional public housing units in each of the next two  fiscal years. This program will meet the most pressing obligations of the  Federal Government into the 1958 fiscal year for planning and building  public housing. By that time the private building industry, aided by the  Housing Act of 1954, will have had the opportunity to assume its full role  in providing adequate housing for our low income families.  
1955_90	1955_90	My recommendations will include a Federal health reinsurance service to  encourage the development of more and better voluntary health insurance  coverage by private organizations. I shall also recommend measures to  improve the medical care of that group of our citizens who, because of  need, receive Federal_State public assistance. These two proposals will  help more of our people to meet the costs of health services.  
1955_91	1955_91	To reduce the gaps in these services, I shall propose:  
1955_97	1955_97	These measures together constitute a comprehensive program holding rich  promise for better health for all of our people.  
1955_101	1955_101	However, such factors as population growth, additional responsibilities of  schools, and increased and longer school attendance have produced an  unprecedented classroom shortage. This shortage is of immediate concern to  all of our people. Positive, affirmative action must be taken now.  
1955_106	1955_106	The outlook for our wage earners can be made still more promising by  several legislative actions.  
1955_109	1955_109	Third, the Administration will propose other important measures including  occupational safety, workmen's compensation for longshoremen and harbor  workers, and the "Eight Hour Laws" applicable to Federal contractors.  Legislation will also be proposed respecting nonoccupational disability  insurance and unemployment compensation in the District of Columbia.  
1955_114	1955_114	Our concern for the individual in our country requires that we consider  several additional problems.  
1955_116	1955_116	As the complex problems of Alaska are resolved, that Territory should  expect to achieve statehood. In the meantime, there is no justification for  deferring the admission to statehood of Hawaii. I again urge approval of  this measure.  
1955_121	1955_121	And now, I return to the point at which I began the faith of our people.  
1955_125	1955_125	To advance, not merely by our words but by our acts, the determination of  our government that every citizen shall have opportunity to develop to his  fullest capacity.  
1955_129	1955_129	The address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 101, p. 94).  
1956_1	1956_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1956_3	1956_3	In the past three years, responding to what our people want their  Government to do, the Congress and the Executive have done much in building  a stronger, better America. There has been broad progress in fostering the  energies of our people, in providing greater opportunity for the  satisfaction of their needs, and in fulfilling their demands for the  strength and security of the Republic.  
1956_6	1956_6	War in Korea ended two and a half years ago. The collective security system  has been powerfully strengthened. Our defenses have been reinforced at  sharply reduced costs. Programs to expand world trade and to harness the  atom for the betterment of mankind have been carried forward. Our economy  has been freed from governmental wage and price controls. Inflation has  been halted; the cost of living stabilized.  
1956_7	1956_7	Government spending has been cut by more than ten billion dollars. Nearly  three hundred thousand positions have been eliminated from the Federal  payroll. Taxes have been substantially reduced. A balanced budget is in  prospect. Social security has been extended to ten million more Americans  and unemployment insurance to four million more. Unprecedented advances in  civil rights have been made. The long_standing and deep_seated problems of  agriculture have been forthrightly attacked.  
1956_10	1956_10	Many measures of great national importance recommended last year to the  Congress still demand immediate attention legislation for school and  highway construction; health and immigration legislation; water resources  legislation; legislation to complete the implementation of our foreign  economic policy; such labor legislation as amendments of the  Labor_Management Relations Act, extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act  to additional groups not now covered, and occupational safety legislation;  and legislation for construction of an atomic_powered exhibit vessel.  
1956_15	1956_15	THE DISCHARGE OF OUR WORLD RESPONSIBILITY  
1956_16	1956_16	Our world policy and our actions are dedicated to the achievement of peace  with justice for all nations.  
1956_20	1956_20	Nevertheless, it is clear that the conflict between international communism  and freedom has taken on a new complexion.  
1956_23	1956_23	In the face of Communist military power, we must, of course, continue to  maintain an effective system of collective security. This involves two  things a system which gives clear warning that armed aggression will be  met by joint action of the free nations, and deterrent military power to  make that warning effective. Moreover, the awesome power of the atom must  be made to serve as a guardian of the free community and of the peace.  
1956_28	1956_28	In the coming year much remains to be done.  
1956_30	1956_30	In the Near East we shall spare no effort in seeking to promote a fair  solution of the tragic dispute between the Arab States and Israel, all of  whom we want as our friends. The United States is ready to do its part to  assure enduring peace in that area. We hope that both sides will make the  contributions necessary to achieve that purpose. In Latin America, we shall  continue to cooperate vigorously in trade and other measures designed to  assist economic progress in the area.  
1956_43	1956_43	THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY  
1956_44	1956_44	Because peace is the keystone of our national policy, our defense program  emphasizes an effective flexible type of power calculated to deter or  repulse any aggression and to preserve the peace. Short of war, we have  never had military strength better adapted to our needs with improved  readiness for emergency use. The maintenance of this strong military  capability for the indefinite future will continue to call for a large  share of our national budget. Our military programs must meet the needs of  today. To build less would expose the nation to aggression. To build  excessively, under the influence of fear, could defeat our purposes and  impair or destroy the very freedom and economic system our military  defenses are designed to protect.  
1956_45	1956_45	We have improved the effectiveness and combat readiness of our forces by  developing and making operational new weapons and by integrating the latest  scientific developments, including new atomic weapons, into our military  plans. We continue to push the production of the most modern military  aircraft. The development of long_range missiles has been on an accelerated  basis for some time. We are moving as rapidly as practicable toward  nuclear_powered aircraft and ships. Combat capability, especially in terms  of firepower, has been substantially increased. We have made the  adjustments in personnel permitted by the cessation of the Korean War, the  buildup of our allies and the introduction of new weapons. The services are  all planning realistically on a long_term basis.  
1956_47	1956_47	In the last analysis our real strength lies in the caliber of the men and  women in our Armed Forces, active and Reserve. Much has been done to  attract and hold capable military personnel, but more needs to be done.  This year, I renew my request of last year for legislation to provide  proper medical care for military dependents and a more equitable survivors'  benefit program. The Administration will prepare additional recommendations  designed to achieve the same objectives, including career incentives for  medical and dental officers and nurses, and increases in the proportion of  regular officers.  
1956_48	1956_48	Closely related to the mission of the Defense Department is the task of the  Federal Civil Defense Administration. A particular point of relationship  arises from the fact that the key to civil defense is the expanded  continental defense program, including the distant early warning system.  Our Federal civil defense authorities have made progress in their program,  and now comprehensive studies are being conducted jointly by the Federal  Civil Defense Administration, the States, and critical target cities to  determine the best procedures that can be adopted in case of an atomic  attack. We must strengthen Federal assistance to the States and cities in  devising the most effective common defense.  
1956_51	1956_51	A third objective of the Administration is:  
1956_53	1956_53	A public office is, indeed, a public trust. None of its aspects is more  demanding than the proper management of the public finances. I refer now  not only to the indispensable virtues of plain honesty and trustworthiness  but also to the prudent, effective and conscientious use of tax money. I  refer also to the attitude of mind that makes efficient and economical  service to the people a watchword in our government.  
1956_54	1956_54	Over the long term, a balanced budget is a sure index to thrifty  management in a home, in a business or in the Federal Government. When  achievement of a balanced budget is for long put off in a business or home,  bankruptcy is the result. But in similar circumstances a government resorts  to inflation of the money supply. This inevitably results in depreciation  of the value of the money, and an increase in the cost of living. Every  investment in personal security is threatened by this process of inflation,  and the real values of the people's savings, whether in the form of  insurance, bonds, pension and retirement funds or savings accounts are  thereby shriveled.  
1956_55	1956_55	We have made long strides these past three years in bringing our Federal  finances under control. The deficit for fiscal year 1953 was almost 9_1/2  billion dollars. Larger deficits seemed certain deficits which would have  depreciated the value of the dollar and pushed the cost of living still  higher. But government waste and extravagance were searched out.  Nonessential activities were dropped. Government expenses were carefully  scrutinized. Total spending was cut by 14 billion dollars below the amount  planned by the previous Administration for the fiscal year 1954.  
1956_56	1956_56	This made possible and it was appropriate in the existing circumstances of  transition to a peacetime economy the largest tax cut in any year in our  history. Almost 7_1/2 billion dollars were released and every taxpayer in  the country benefited. Almost two_thirds of the savings went directly to  individuals. This tax cut also helped to build up the economy, to make jobs  in industry and to increase the production .of the many things desired to  improve the scale of living for the great majority of Americans.  
1956_57	1956_57	The strong expansion of the economy, coupled with a constant care for  efficiency in government operations and an alert guard against waste and  duplication, has brought us to a prospective balance between income and  expenditure. This is being done while we continue to strengthen our  military security.  
1956_61	1956_61	It is unquestionably true that our present tax level is very burdensome  and, in the interest of long term and continuous economic growth, should be  reduced when we prudently can. It is essential, in the sound management of  the Government's finances, that we be mindful of our enormous national debt  and of the obligation we have toward future Americans to reduce that debt  whenever we can appropriately do so. Under conditions of high peacetime  prosperity, such as now exist, we can never justify going further into debt  to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children. So, in the  present state of our financial affairs, I earnestly believe that a tax cut  can be deemed justifiable only when it will not unbalance the budget, a  budget which makes provision for some reduction, even though modest, in our  national debt. In this way we can best maintain fiscal integrity.  
1956_62	1956_62	A fourth aim of our program is:  
1956_63	1956_63	TO FOSTER A STRONG ECONOMY  
1956_68	1956_68	In successful prosecution of the war, the nation called for the utmost  effort of its farmers. Their response was superb, their contribution  unsurpassed. Farmers are not now to be blamed for the mountainous,  price_depressing surpluses produced in response to wartime policies and  laws that were too long continued. War markets are not the markets of  peacetime. Failure to recognize that basic fact by a timely adjustment of  wartime legislation brought its inevitable result in peacetime surpluses,  lower prices and lower incomes for our farmers.  
1956_77	1956_77	I shall briefly mention four other subjects directly related to the  well_being of the economy, preliminary to their fuller discussion in the  Economic Report and later communications.  
1956_80	1956_80	A comprehensive legislative program for water conservation will be  submitted to the Congress during the Session. The development of our water  resources cannot be accomplished overnight. The need is such that we must  make faster progress and without delay. Therefore, I strongly recommend  that action be taken at this Session on such wholly Federal projects as the  Colorado River Storage Project and the Fryingpan_Arkansas Project; on the  John Day partnership project, and other projects which provide for  cooperative action between the Federal Government and non_Federal  interests; and on legislation, which makes provision for Federal  participation in small projects under the primary sponsorship of agencies  of State and local government.  
1956_85	1956_85	Area Redevelopment  
1956_88	1956_88	Highway Legislation.  
1956_90	1956_90	In my message of February 22, 1955, I urged that measures be taken to  complete the vital 40,000 mile interstate system over a period of 10 years  at an estimated Federal cost of approximately 25 billion dollars. No  program was adopted.  
1956_92	1956_92	Aside from agriculture and the four subjects specifically mentioned, an  integral part of our efforts to foster a strong and expanding free economy  is keeping open the door of opportunity to new and small enterprises,  checking monopoly, and preserving a competitive environment. In this past  year the steady improvement in the economic health of small business has  reinforced the vitality of our competitive economy. We shall continue to  help small business concerns to obtain access to adequate financing and to  competent counsel on management, production, and marketing problems.  
1956_101	1956_101	A fundamental belief shines forth in this Republic. We believe in the worth  and dignity of the individual. We know that if we are to govern ourselves  wisely in the tradition of America we must have the opportunity to  develop our individual capacities to the utmost.  
1956_108	1956_108	Other needs in the area of social welfare include increased child welfare  services, extension of the program of aid to dependent children,  intensified attack on juvenile delinquency, and special attention to the  problems of mentally retarded children. The training of more skilled  workers for these fields and the quest for new knowledge through research  in social welfare are essential. Similarly the problems of our aged people  need our attention.  
1956_112	1956_112	The response of government to human concerns embraces, of course, other  measures of broad public interest, and of special interest to our working  men and women. The need still exists for improvement of the Labor  Management Relations Act. The recommendations I submitted to the Congress  last year take into account not only the interests of labor and management  but also the public welfare. The needed amendments should be enacted  without further delay.  
1956_115	1956_115	In the field of human needs, we must carry forward the housing program,  which is contributing so greatly to the well_being of our people and the  prosperity of our economy. Home ownership is now advanced to the point  where almost three of every five families in our cities, towns, and suburbs  own the houses they live in.  
1956_118	1956_118	With so large a number of the American people desiring to modernize and  improve existing dwellings, I recommend that the Title 1 program for  permanent improvements in the home be liberalized.  
1956_120	1956_120	The legislation I have recommended for workers in private industry should  be accompanied by a parallel effort for the welfare of Government  employees. We have accomplished much in this field, including a  contributory life insurance program; equitable pay increases and a fringe  benefits program, covering many needed personnel policy changes, from  improved premium pay to a meaningful incentive award program.  
1956_121	1956_121	Additional personnel management legislation is needed in this Session. As I  stated last year, an executive pay increase is essential to efficient  governmental management. Such an increase, together with needed adjustments  in the pay for the top career positions, is also necessary to the equitable  completion of the Federal pay program initiated last year. Other  legislation will be proposed, including legislation for prepaid group  health insurance for employees and their dependents and to effect major  improvements in the Civil Service retirement system.  
1956_123	1956_123	We are proud of the progress our people have made in the field of civil  rights. In Executive Branch operations throughout the nation, elimination  of discrimination and segregation is all but completed. Progress is also  being made among contractors engaged in furnishing Government services and  requirements. Every citizen now has the opportunity to fit himself for and  to hold a position of responsibility in the service of his country. In the  District of Columbia, through the voluntary cooperation of the people,  discrimination and segregation are disappearing from hotels, theaters,  restaurants and other facilities.  
1956_124	1956_124	It is disturbing that in some localities allegations persist that Negro  citizens are being deprived of their right to vote and are likewise being  subjected to unwarranted economic pressures. I recommend that the substance  of these charges be thoroughly examined by a Bipartisan Commission created  by the Congress. It is hoped that such a commission will be established  promptly so that it may arrive at findings which can receive early  consideration.  
1956_129	1956_129	In keeping with our responsibility of world leadership and in our own self  interest, I again point out to the Congress the urgent need for revision of  the immigration and nationality laws. Our nation has always welcomed  immigrants to our shores. The wisdom of such a policy is clearly shown by  the fact that America has been built by immigrants and the descendants of  immigrants. That policy must be continued realistically with present day  conditions in mind.  
1956_131	1956_131	The law should be amended to permit the Secretary of State and the Attorney  General to waive the requirements of fingerprinting on a reciprocal basis  for persons coming to this country for temporary visits. This and other  changes in the law are long overdue and should be taken care of promptly.  Detailed recommendations for revision of the immigration laws will be  submitted to the Congress.  
1956_132	1956_132	I am happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrants under  the Refugee Relief Act of 1953; however, I again request this Congress to  approve without further delay the urgently needed amendments to that act  which I submitted in the last Session. Because of the high prosperity in  Germany and Austria, the number of immigrants from those countries will be  reduced. This will make available thousands of unfilled openings which I  recommend be distributed to Greece and Italy and to escapees from behind  the Iron Curtain.  
1956_133	1956_133	Once again I ask the Congress to join with me in demonstrating our belief  in the right of suffrage. I renew my request that the principle of  self_government be extended and the right of suffrage granted to the  citizens of the District of Columbia.  
1956_135	1956_135	Progress, however, will be realized only as it is more than matched by a  continuing growth in the spiritual strength of the nation. Our dedication  to moral values must be complete in our dealings abroad and in our  relationships among ourselves. We have single_minded devotion to the common  good of America. Never must we forget that this means the well_being, the  prosperity, the security of all Americans in every walk of life.  
1957_1	1957_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1957_4	1957_4	In the world today, the surging and understandable tide of nationalism is  marked by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny, injustice,  inequality and poverty. As individuals, joined in a common hunger for  freedom, men and women and even children pit their spirit against guns and  tanks. On a larger scale, in an ever more persistent search for the  self_respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which  national independence must rest, peoples sever old ties; seek new  alliances; experiment sometimes dangerously in their struggle to satisfy  these human aspirations.  
1957_14	1957_14	Through the past four years these principles have guided the legislative  programs submitted by the Administration to the Congress. As we attempt to  apply them to current events, domestic and foreign, we must take into  account the complex entity that is the United States of America; what  endangers it; what can improve it.  
1957_15	1957_15	The visible structure is our American economy itself. After more than a  century and a half of constant expansion, it is still rich in a wide  variety of natural resources. It is first among nations in its people's  mastery of industrial skills. It is productive beyond our own needs of many  foodstuffs and industrial products. It is rewarding to all our citizens in  opportunity to earn and to advance in self_realization and in  self_expression. It is fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural  and religious centers. It is vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative  and willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise. It is  productive of a widely shared prosperity.  
1957_21	1957_21	In this regard I call on leaders in business and in labor to think well on  their responsibility to the American people. With all elements of our  society, they owe the Nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary  tendencies that are always at work in a dynamic economy operating at  today's high levels. They can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such  tendencies by their wage and price policies.  
1957_28	1957_28	In the light of this report, there are two things I believe we should keep  constantly in mind. The first is that each of our great river valleys  should be considered as a whole. Piecemeal operations within each lesser  drainage area can be self_defeating or, at the very least, needlessly  expensive. The second is that the domestic and industrial demands for water  grow far more rapidly than does our population.  
1957_43	1957_43	The Administration will, through future messages either directly from me or  from heads of the departments and agencies, transmit to the Congress  specific recommendations. These will involve our financial and fiscal  affairs, our military and civil defenses; the administration of justice;  our agricultural economy; our domestic and foreign commerce; the urgently  needed increase in our postal rates; the development of our natural  resources; our labor laws, including our labor_management relations  legislation, and vital aspects of the health, education and welfare of our  people. There will be special recommendations dealing with such subjects as  atomic energy, the furthering of public works, the continued efforts to  eliminate government competition with the businesses of tax_paying  citizens.  
1957_48	1957_48	Another truth is that our survival in today's world requires modern,  adequate, dependable military strength. Our Nation has made great strides  in assuring a modern defense, so armed in new weapons, so deployed, so  equipped, that today our security force is the most powerful in our  peacetime history. It can punish heavily any enemy who undertakes to attack  us. It is a major deterrent to war.  
1957_55	1957_55	This quest requires as well a constructive attitude among all the nations  of the free world toward expansion of trade and investment, that can give  all of us opportunity to work out economic betterment.  
1957_59	1957_59	World events have magnified both the responsibilities and the opportunities  of the United States Information Agency. Just as, in recent months, the  voice of communism has become more shaken and confused, the voice of truth  must be more clearly heard. To enable our Information Agency to cope with  these new responsibilities and opportunities, I am asking the Congress to  increase appreciably the appropriations for this program and for  legislation establishing a career service for the Agency's overseas foreign  service officers.  
1957_60	1957_60	The recent historic events in Hungary demand that all free nations share to  the extent of their capabilities in the responsibility of granting asylum  to victims of Communist persecution. I request the Congress promptly to  enact legislation to regularize the status in the United States of  Hungarian refugees brought here as parolees. I shall shortly recommend to  the Congress by special message the changes in our immigration laws that I  deem necessary in the light of our world responsibilities.  
1957_62	1957_62	Only five days ago I expressed to you the grave concern of your Government  over the threat of Soviet aggression in the Middle East. I asked for  Congressional authorization to help counter this threat. I say again that  this matter is of vital and immediate importance to the Nation's and the  free world's security and peace. By our proposed programs in the Middle  East, we hope to assist in establishing a climate in which constructive and  long_term solutions to basic problems of the area may be sought.  
1957_69	1957_69	In short, the world has so shrunk that all free nations are our neighbors.  Without cooperative neighbors, the United States cannot maintain its own  security and welfare, because:  
1957_70	1957_70	First, America's vital interests are world_wide, embracing both hemispheres  and every continent.  
1957_74	1957_74	May we at home, here at the Seat of Government, in all the cities and towns  and farmlands of America, support these principles in a personal effort of  dedication. Thereby each of us can help establish a secure world order in  which opportunity for freedom and justice will be more widespread, and in  which the resources now dissipated on the armaments of war can be released  for the life and growth of all humanity.  
1957_78	1957_78	Our country and its government have made mistakes human mistakes. They  have been of the head not of the heart. And it is still true that the  great concept of the dignity of all men, alike created in the image of the  Almighty, has been the compass by which we have tried and are trying to  steer our course.  
1957_80	1957_80	To achieve a more perfect fidelity to it, I submit, is a worthy ambition as  we meet together in these first days of this, the first session of the 85th  Congress.  
1957_81	1957_81	The Address as reported from the floor appears in the Congressional Record  (vol. 103, p. 387).  
1958_1	1958_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 85th Congress:  
1958_7	1958_7	There are two tasks confronting us that so far outweigh all other that I  shall devote this year's message entirely to them. The first is to ensure  our safety through strength.  
1958_8	1958_8	As to our strength, I have repeatedly voiced this conviction: We now have a  broadly based and efficient defensive strength, including a great deterrent  power, which is, for the present, our main guarantee against war; but,  unless we act wisely and promptly, we could lose that capacity to deter  attack or defend ourselves.  
1958_9	1958_9	My profoundest conviction is that the American people will say, as one man:  No matter what the exertions or sacrifices, we shall maintain that  necessary strength!  
1958_10	1958_10	But we could make no more tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on  military strength.  
1958_11	1958_11	For if we did only this, the future would hold nothing for the world but an  Age of Terror.  
1958_16	1958_16	But what makes the Soviet threat unique in history is its  all inclusiveness. Every human activity is pressed into service as a  weapon of expansion. Trade, economic development, military power, arts,  science, education, the whole world of ideas all are harnessed to this  same chariot of expansion.  
1958_17	1958_17	The Soviets are, in short, waging total cold war.  
1958_18	1958_18	The only answer to a regime that wages total cold war is to wage total  peace.  
1958_21	1958_21	Military power serves the cause of security by making prohibitive the cost  of any aggressive attack.  
1958_29	1958_29	At this moment, the consensus of opinion is that we are probably somewhat  behind the Soviets in some areas of long_range ballistic missile  development. But it is my conviction, based on close study of all relevant  intelligence, that if we make the necessary effort, we will have the  missiles, in the needed quantity and in time, to sustain and strengthen the  deterrent power of our increasingly efficient bombers. One encouraging fact  evidencing this ability is the rate of progress we have achieved since we  began to concentrate on these missiles.  
1958_30	1958_30	The intermediate ballistic missiles, Thor and Jupiter, have already been  ordered into production. The parallel progress in the intercontinental  ballistic missile effort will be advanced by our plans for acceleration.  The development of the submarine_based Polaris missile system has  progressed so well that its future procurement schedules are being moved  forward markedly.  
1958_38	1958_38	Up to this point, I have talked solely about our military strength to deter  a possible future war.  
1958_43	1958_43	Admittedly, most of us did not anticipate the psychological impact upon the  world of the launching of the first earth satellite. Let us not make the  same kind of mistake in another field, by failing to anticipate the much  more serious impact of the Soviet economic offensive.  
1958_46	1958_46	If our history teaches us anything, it is this lesson: so far as the  economic potential of our nation is concerned, the believers in the future  of America have always been the realists. I count myself as one of this  company.  
1958_52	1958_52	1. DEFENSE REORGANIZATION  
1958_53	1958_53	The first need is to assure ourselves that military organization  facilitates rather than hinders the functioning of the military  establishment in maintaining the security of the nation.  
1958_54	1958_54	Since World War II, the purpose of achieving maximum organizational  efficiency in a modern defense establishment has several times occasioned  action by the Congress and by the Executive.  
1958_55	1958_55	The advent of revolutionary new devices, bringing with them the problem of  overall continental defense, creates new difficulties, reminiscent of those  attending the advent of the airplane half a century ago.  
1958_56	1958_56	Some of the important new weapons which technology has produced do not fit  into any existing service pattern. They cut across all services, involve  all services, and transcend all services, at every stage from development  to operation. In some instances they defy classification according to  branch of service.  
1958_59	1958_59	I am not attempting today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service  rivalries. But one thing is sure. Whatever they are, America wants them  stopped.  
1958_61	1958_61	Meanwhile, without anticipating the detailed form that a reorganization  should take, I can state its main lines in terms of objectives:  
1958_64	1958_64	In recognition of the need for single control in some of our most advanced  development projects, the Secretary of Defense has already decided to  concentrate into one organization all the anti_missile and satellite  technology undertaken within the Department of Defense.  
1958_65	1958_65	Another requirement of military organization is a clear subordination of  the military services to duly constituted civilian authority. This control  must be real; not merely on the surface.  
1958_66	1958_66	Next there must be assurance that an excessive number of compartments in  organization will not create costly and confusing compartments in our  scientific and industrial effort.  
1958_69	1958_69	The second major action item is the acceleration of the defense effort in  particular areas affected by the fast pace of scientific and technological  advance.  
1958_72	1958_72	We must protect and disperse our striking forces and increase their  readiness for instant reaction. This means more base facilities and standby  crews.  
1958_73	1958_73	We must maintain deterrent retaliatory power. This means, among other  things, stepped_up long range missile programs; accelerated programs for  other effective missile systems; and, for some years, more advanced  aircraft.  
1958_81	1958_81	As for the mutual economic assistance program, the benefit to us is  threefold. First, the countries receiving this aid become bulwarks against  communist encroachment as their military defenses and economies are  strengthened. Nations that are conscious of a steady improvement in their  industry, education, health and standard of living are not apt to fall prey  to the blandishments of communist imperialists.  
1958_83	1958_83	Third, the mutual confidence that comes from working together on  constructive projects creates an atmosphere in which real understanding and  peace can flourish.  
1958_85	1958_85	In proposals for future economic aid, I am stressing a greater use of  repayable loans, through the Development Loan Fund, through funds generated  by sale of surplus farm products, and through the Export_Import Bank.  
1958_87	1958_87	One great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past has been, not a  rational argument against it on the merits, but a catchword: "give_away  program."  
1958_88	1958_88	The real fact is that no investment we make in our own security and peace  can pay us greater dividends than necessary amounts of economic aid to  friendly nations.  
1958_94	1958_94	World trade supports a significant segment of American industry and  agriculture. It provides employment for four and one_half million American  workers. It helps supply our ever increasing demand for raw materials. It  provides the opportunity for American free enterprise to develop on a  worldwide scale. It strengthens our friends and increases their desire to  be friends. World trade helps to lay the groundwork for peace by making all  free nations of the world stronger and more self_reliant.  
1958_95	1958_95	America is today the world's greatest trading nation. If we use this great  asset wisely to meet the expanding demands of the world, we shall not only  provide future opportunities for our own business, agriculture, and labor,  but in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospects for  a prosperous, harmonious world.  
1958_96	1958_96	As President McKinley said, as long ago as 1901: "Isolation is no longer  possible or desirable .... The period of exclusiveness is past."  
1958_97	1958_97	5. SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION WITH OUR ALLIES  
1958_99	1958_99	It is wasteful in the extreme for friendly allies to consume talent and  money in solving problems that their friends have already solved all  because of artificial barriers to sharing. We cannot afford to cut  ourselves off from the brilliant talents and minds of scientists in  friendly countries. The task ahead will be hard enough without handcuffs of  our own making.  
1958_100	1958_100	The groundwork for this kind of cooperation has already been laid in  discussions among NATO countries. Promptness in following through with  legislation will be the best possible evidence of American unity of purpose  in cooperating with our friends.  
1958_105	1958_105	But Federal action can do only a part of the job. In both education and  research, redoubled exertions will be necessary on the part of all  Americans if we are to rise to the demands of our times. This means hard  work on the part of state and local governments, private industry, schools  and colleges, private organizations and foundations, teachers, parents,  and perhaps most important of all the student himself, with his bag of  books and his homework.  
1958_106	1958_106	With this kind of all_inclusive campaign, I have no doubt that we can  create the intellectual capital we need for the years ahead, invest it in  the right places and do all this, not as regimented pawns, but as free men  and women!  
1958_108	1958_108	Seventh: To provide for this extra effort for security, we must apply stern  tests of priority to other expenditures, both military and civilian. This  extra effort involves, most immediately, the need for a supplemental  defense appropriation of $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1958.  
1958_120	1958_120	Now, may I try to give you some concrete examples of the kind of works of  peace that might make a beginning in the new direction.  
1958_123	1958_123	Indeed, we would be willing to pool our efforts with the Soviets in other  campaigns against the diseases that are the common enemy of all  mortals such as cancer and heart disease.  
1958_128	1958_128	But of all the works of peace, none is more needed now than a real first  step toward disarmament.  
1958_130	1958_130	But the world cannot afford to stand still on disarmament! We must never  give up the search for a basis of agreement.  
1958_132	1958_132	But a disarmament proposal, to hold real promise, must at the minimum have  one feature: reliable means to ensure compliance by all. It takes actions  and demonstrated integrity on both sides to create and sustain confidence.  And confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement is vital, not only to the  signers of the agreement, but also to the millions of people all over the  world who are weary of tensions and armaments.  
1958_133	1958_133	I say once more, to all peoples, that we will always go the extra mile with  anyone on earth if it will bring us nearer a genuine peace.  
1958_134	1958_134	CONCLUSION  
1958_135	1958_135	These, then, are the ways in which we must funnel our energies more  efficiently into the task of advancing security and peace.  
1958_137	1958_137	After all, it is no good demanding sacrifice in general terms one day, and  the next day, for local reasons, opposing the elimination of some unneeded  Federal facility.  
1958_140	1958_140	My friends of the Congress: The world is waiting to see how wisely and  decisively a free representative government will now act.  
1958_141	1958_141	I believe that this Congress possesses and will display the wisdom promptly  to do its part in translating into law the actions demanded by our nation's  interests. But, to make law effective, our kind of government needs the  full voluntary support of millions of Americans for these actions.  
1959_1	1959_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 86th Congress, my fellow  citizens:  
1959_9	1959_9	We cannot build peace through desire alone. Moreover, we have learned the  bitter lesson that international agreements, historically considered by us  as sacred, are regarded in Communist doctrine and in practice to be mere  scraps of paper. The most recent proof of their disdain of international  obligations, solemnly undertaken, is their announced intention to abandon  their responsibilities respecting Berlin.  
1959_12	1959_12	To achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any  dimension. If, despite our best efforts, a local dispute should flare into  armed hostilities, the next problem would be to keep the conflict from  spreading, and so compromising freedom. In support of these objectives we  maintain forces of great power and flexibility.  
1959_13	1959_13	Our formidable air striking forces are a powerful deterrent to general war.  Large and growing portions of these units can depart from their bases in a  matter of minutes.  
1959_17	1959_17	Great strides have been made in the development of ballistic missiles.  Intermediate range missiles are now being deployed in operational units.  The Arias intercontinental ballistic missile program has been marked by  rapid development as evidenced by recent successful tests. Missile training  units have been established and launching sites are far along in  construction.  
1959_19	1959_19	We have successfully placed five satellites in orbit, which have gathered  information of scientific importance never before available. Our latest  satellite illustrates our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadows new  developments in world_wide communications.  
1959_21	1959_21	Our atomic submarines have shattered endurance records and made historic  voyages under the North Polar Sea.  
1959_23	1959_23	All this is given only as a matter of history; as a record of our progress  in space and ballistic missile fields in no more than four years of  intensive effort. At the same time we clearly recognize that some of the  recent Soviet accomplishments in this particular technology are indeed  brilliant.  
1959_24	1959_24	Under the law enacted last year the Department of Defense is being  reorganized to give the Secretary of Defense full authority over the  military establishment. Greater efficiency, more cohesive effort and  speedier reaction to emergencies are among the many advantages we are  already noting from these changes.  
1959_26	1959_26	National Security programs account for nearly sixty percent of the entire  Federal budget for this coming fiscal year.  
1959_29	1959_29	This year we are investing an aggregate of close to $7 billion in missile  programs alone.  
1959_31	1959_31	Our latest atomic submarines will cost $50 millions each, while some  special types will cost three times as much.  
1959_32	1959_32	We are now ordering fighter aircraft which are priced at fifty times as  much as the fighters of World War II.  
1959_35	1959_35	Such expenditures demand both balance and perspective in our planning for  defense. At every turn, we must weigh, judge and select. Needless  duplication of weapons and forces must be avoided.  
1959_36	1959_36	We must guard against feverish building of vast armaments to meet glibly  predicted moments of so_called "maximum peril." The threat we face is not  sporadic or dated: It is continuous. Hence we must not be swayed in our  calculations either by groundless fear or by complacency. We must avoid  extremes, for vacillation between extremes is inefficient, costly, and  destructive of morale. In these days of unceasing technological advance, we  must plan our defense expenditures systematically and with care, fully  recognizing that obsolescence compels the never_ending replacement of older  weapons with new ones.  
1959_37	1959_37	The defense budget for the coming year has been planned on the basis of  these principles and considerations. Over these many months I have  personally participated in its development.  
1959_38	1959_38	The aim is a sensible posture of defense. The secondary aim is increased  efficiency and avoidance of waste. Both are achieved by this budgetary  plan.  
1959_41	1959_41	Constantly we seek new ways to make more effective our contribution to this  system of collective security. Recently I have asked a Committee of eminent  Americans of both parties to re_appraise our military assistance programs  and the relative emphasis which should be placed on military and economic  aid.  
1959_43	1959_43	Any survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a  feeling of regret that so much of our effort and resources must be devoted  to armaments. At Geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and  other agreements that may help to open up, with some promise, the issues of  international disarmament. America will never give up the hope that  eventually all nations can, with mutual confidence, drastically reduce  these non_productive expenditures. II.  
1959_44	1959_44	The material foundation of our national safety is a strong and expanding  economy. This we have and this we must maintain. Only with such an economy  can we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well_being of our  people.  
1959_48	1959_48	After we have provided wisely for our military strength, we must judge how  to allocate our remaining government resources most effectively to promote  our well_being and economic growth.  
1959_49	1959_49	Federal programs that will benefit all citizens are moving forward.  
1959_51	1959_51	Each of these additional outlays is being made necessary by the surging  growth of America.  
1959_52	1959_52	Let me illustrate. Responsive to this growth, Federal grants and long term  loans to assist 14 major types of capital improvements in our cities will  total over 2 billion dollars in 1960 double the expenditure of two years  ago. The major responsibility for development in these fields rests in the  localities, even though the Federal Government will continue to do its  proper part in meeting the genuine needs of a burgeoning population.  
1959_53	1959_53	But the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our  needs. We need only to act wisely and confidently.  
1959_55	1959_55	The basic question facing us today is more than mere survival the military  defense of national life and territory. It is the preservation of a way of  life.  
1959_60	1959_60	To define these goals, I intend to mobilize help from every available  source.  
1959_65	1959_65	We must have teachers of competence. To obtain and hold them we need  standards. We need a National Goal. Once established I am certain that  public opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment.  
1959_66	1959_66	Such studies would be helpful, I believe, to government at all levels and  to all individuals. The goals so established could help us see our current  needs in perspective. They will spur progress.  
1959_68	1959_68	We must avoid any contribution to inflationary processes, which could  disrupt sound growth in our economy.  
1959_69	1959_69	Prices have displayed a welcome stability in recent months and, if we are  wise and resolute, we will not tolerate inflation in the years to come. But  history makes clear the risks inherent in any failure to deal firmly with  the .basic causes of inflation. Two of the most important of these causes  are the wage_price spiral and continued deficit financing.  
1959_72	1959_72	Inflation can be prevented. But this demands statesmanship on the part of  business and labor leaders and of government at all levels.  
1959_75	1959_75	First, I shall submit a balanced budget for the next year, a year expected  to be the most prosperous in our history. It is a realistic budget with  wholly attainable objectives.  
1959_79	1959_79	In this hope, I am requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare  appropriate proposals for revising, at the proper time, our tax structure,  to remove inequities and to enhance incentives for all Americans to work,  to save, and to invest. Such recommendations will be made as soon as our  fiscal condition permits. These prospects will be brightened if 1960  expenditures do not exceed the levels recommended.  
1959_80	1959_80	Second, I shall recommend to the Congress that the Chief Executive be given  the responsibility either to approve or to veto specific items in  appropriations and authorization bills. This would save tax dollars.  
1959_84	1959_84	By the end of this fiscal year it is estimated that there will be in  Government hands surplus farm products worth about nine billion dollars.  And by July 1, 1959, Government expenditures for storage, interest, and  handling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion  dollars a year.  
1959_85	1959_85	This level of expenditure for farm products could be made willingly for a  temporary period if it were leading to a sound solution of the problem. But  unfortunately this is not true. We need new legislation.  
1959_88	1959_88	These fiscal and related actions will help create an environment of price  stability for economic growth. However, certain additional measures are  needed.  
1959_90	1959_90	I am establishing a continuing Cabinet group on Price Stability for  Economic Growth to study governmental and private policies affecting costs,  prices, and economic growth. It will strive also to build a better public  understanding of the conditions necessary for maintaining growth and price  stability.  
1959_93	1959_93	I take up next certain aspects of our international situation and our  programs to strengthen it.  
1959_95	1959_95	There can be no such thing as Fortress America. If ever we were reduced to  the isolation implied by that term, we would occupy a prison, not a  fortress. The question whether we can afford to help other nations that  want to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own means,  has only one answer: we can and we must, we have been doing so since 1947.  
1959_103	1959_103	Private enterprise continues to make major contributions to economic  development in all parts of the world. But we have not yet marshalled the  full potential of American business for this task, particularly in  countries which have recently attained their independence. I shall present  to this Congress a program designed to encourage greater participation by  private enterprise in economic development abroad.  
1959_104	1959_104	Further, all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do  much more than help build sound economies. The spiritual, intellectual, and  physical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis  determine their willingness and their ability to resist Communism.  
1959_109	1959_109	Because we are human we err. But as free men we are also responsible for  correcting the errors and imperfections of our ways.  
1959_112	1959_112	To protect the rights and freedoms of individual union members, including  the basic right to free and secret elections of officers.  
1959_113	1959_113	To advance true and responsible collective bargaining.  
1959_115	1959_115	The workers and the public must have these vital protections.  
1959_117	1959_117	The image of America abroad is not improved when school children, through  closing of some of our schools and through no fault of their own, are  deprived of their opportunity for an education.  
1959_118	1959_118	The government of a free people has no purpose more noble than to work for  the maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law. This is not  the sole responsibility of any one branch of our government. The judicial  arm, which has the ultimate authority for interpreting the Constitution,  has held that certain state laws and practices discriminate upon racial  grounds and are unconstitutional. Whenever the supremacy of the  Constitution of the United States is challenged I shall continue to take  every action necessary to uphold it.  
1959_119	1959_119	One of the fundamental concepts of our constitutional system is that it  guarantees to every individual, regardless of race, religion, or national  origin, the equal protection of the laws. Those of us who are privileged to  hold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this  inspiring objective. We can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in  teaching, persuading, demonstrating, and in enforcing the law.  
1959_120	1959_120	We are making noticeable progress in the field of civil rights we are  moving forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people  everywhere in the United States. In the interest of the nation and of each  of its citizens, that progress must continue.  
1959_122	1959_122	By moving steadily toward the goal of greater freedom under law, for our  own people, we shall be the better prepared to work for the cause of  freedom under law throughout the world.  
1959_123	1959_123	All peoples are solely tired of the fear, destruction, and the waste of  war. As never before, the world knows the human and material costs of war  and seeks to replace force with a genuine role of law among nations.  
1959_125	1959_125	Finally let us remind ourselves that Marxist scripture is not new; it is  not the gospel of the future. Its basic objective is dictatorship, old as  history. What is new is the shining prospect that man can build a world  where all can live in dignity.  
1959_126	1959_126	We seek victory not over any nation or people but over the ancient  enemies of us all; victory over ignorance, poverty, disease, and human  degradation wherever they may be found.  
1960_2	1960_2	Seven years ago I entered my present office with one long_held resolve  overriding all others. I was then, and remain now, determined that the  United States shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of  peace realizing that peace cannot be for ourselves alone, but for peoples  everywhere. This determination is shared by the entire Congress indeed, by  all Americans.  
1960_3	1960_3	My purpose today is to discuss some features of America's position, both at  home and in her relations to others.  
1960_4	1960_4	First, I point out that for us, annual self_examination is made a definite  necessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy  equilibrium, with our side committed to its own protection and against  aggression by the other.  
1960_5	1960_5	With both sides of this divided world in possession of unbelievably  destructive weapons, mankind approaches a state where mutual annihilation  becomes a possibility. No other fact of today's world equals this in  importance it colors everything we say, plan, and do.  
1960_6	1960_6	There is demanded of us, vigilance, determination, and the dedication of  whatever portion of our resources that will provide adequate security,  especially a real deterrent to aggression. These things we are doing.  
1960_7	1960_7	All these facts emphasize the importance of striving incessantly for a just  peace.  
1960_16	1960_16	Still another avenue may be found in the field of disarmament, in which the  Soviets have professed a readiness to negotiate seriously. They have not,  however, made clear the plans they may have, if any, for mutual inspection  and verification the essential condition for any extensive measure of  disarmament.  
1960_17	1960_17	There is one instance where our initiative for peace has recently been  successful. A multi_lateral treaty signed last month provides for the  exclusively peaceful use of Antarctica, assured by a system of inspection.  It provides for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent,  and prohibits nuclear explosions there pending general international  agreement on the subject. The Treaty is a significant contribution toward  peace, international cooperation, and the advancement of science. I shall  transmit its text to the Senate for consideration and approval in the near  future.  
1960_21	1960_21	We and our friends are, of course, concerned with self_defense. Growing out  of this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a  great stake in the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly  emerging nations. These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to  decent levels of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help  from, and finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their  hostility to freedom.  
1960_22	1960_22	Their natural desire for a better life must not be frustrated by  withholding from them necessary technical and investment assistance. This  is a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also by every nation  cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help.  
1960_23	1960_23	In recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan  have made great economic progress. Their newly found economic strength is  eloquent testimony to the striking success of the policies of economic  cooperation which we and they have pursued.  
1960_26	1960_26	America did not become great through softness and self_indulgence. Her  miraculous progress and achievements flow from other qualities far more  worthy and substantial   
1960_27	1960_27	 adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious  philosophy  
1960_28	1960_28	 a satisfaction in hard work  
1960_29	1960_29	 the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes  
1960_34	1960_34	The immediate need for this kind of cooperation is underscored by the  strain in our international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign  business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the  expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments  overseas, to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the  less developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments  approached $4 billion.  
1960_35	1960_35	Continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would, over time,  impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free  World.  
1960_37	1960_37	New nations, and others struggling with the problems of development, will  progress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess  the will and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, progress in a  national transformation can be only gradually earned; there is no easy and  quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. But, just as we drew  on Europe for assistance in our earlier years, so now do those new and  emerging nations that have this faith and determination deserve help.  
1960_38	1960_38	Over the last fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political  independence. Others are doing so each year. Most of them are woefully  lacking in technical capacity and in investment capital; without Free World  support in these matters they cannot effectively progress in freedom.  
1960_41	1960_41	All of us must realize, of course, that development in freedom by the newly  emerging nations, is no mere matter of obtaining outside financial  assistance. An indispensable element in this process is a strong and  continuing determination on the part of these nations to exercise the  national discipline necessary for any sustained development period. These  qualities of determination are particularly essential because of the fact  that the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious  rather than revolutionary. Moreover, everyone should be aware that the  development process is no short term phenomenon. Many years are required  for even the most favorably situated countries.  
1960_42	1960_42	I shall continue to urge the American people, in the interests of their own  security, prosperity and peace, to make sure that their own part of this  great project be amply and cheerfully supported. Free World decisions in  this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world  progress in freedom.  
1960_43	1960_43	Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar needs.  
1960_44	1960_44	A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared  to assist in the development effort. During the past year I have discussed  this matter with the leaders of several Western Nations.  
1960_45	1960_45	Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization for European Economic  Cooperation could help with initial studies. The goal is to enlist all  available economic resources in the industrialized Free World_especially  private investment capital. But I repeat that .this help, no matter how  great, can be lastingly effective only if it is used as a supplement to the  strength of spirit and will of the people of the newly_developing nations.  
1960_49	1960_49	No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a  high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in  negotiating the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually  enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not weaken the  means of defending our institutions.  
1960_65	1960_65	 the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged  labor_management stalemate;  
1960_67	1960_67	 the continuing threat of inflation, together with the persisting tendency  toward fiscal irresponsibility;  
1960_72	1960_72	To me, it seems almost absurd for the United States to recognize the need,  and so earnestly to seek, for cooperation among the nations unless we can  achieve voluntary, dependable, abiding cooperation among the important  segments of our own free society.  
1960_73	1960_73	Failure to face up to basic issues in areas other than those of  labor_management can cause serious strains on the firm freedom supports of  our society.  
1960_74	1960_74	I refer to agriculture as one of these areas.  
1960_76	1960_76	Today our farm problem is totally different. It is that of effectively  adjusting to the changes caused by a scientific revolution. When the  original farm laws were written, an hour's farm labor produced only one  fourth as much wheat as at present. Farm legislation is woefully  out_of_date, ineffective, and expensive.  
1960_79	1960_79	Another issue that we must meet squarely is that of living within our  means. This requires restraint in expenditure, constant reassessment of  priorities, and the maintenance of stable prices.  
1960_80	1960_80	We must prevent inflation. Here is an opponent of so many guises that it is  sometimes difficult to recognize. But our clear need is to stop continuous  and general price rises a need that all of us can see and feel.  
1960_90	1960_90	This budget will help ease pressures in our credit and capital markets. It  will enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of  our economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability  to be fiscally responsible.  
1960_93	1960_93	In all our hopes and plans for a better world we all recognize that  provincial and racial prejudices must be combatted. In the long perspective  of history, the right to vote has been one of the strongest pillars of a  free society. Our first duty is to protect this right against all  encroachment. In spite of constitutional guarantees, and notwithstanding  much progress of recent years, bias still deprives some persons in this  country of equal protection of the laws.  
1960_94	1960_94	Early in your last session I recommended legislation which would help  eliminate several practices discriminating against the basic rights of  Americans. The Civil Rights Commission has developed additional  constructive recommendations. I hope that these will be among the matters  to be seriously considered in the current session. I trust that Congress  will thus signal to the world that our Government is striving for equality  under law for all our people.  
1960_95	1960_95	Each year and in many ways our nation continues to undergo profound change  and growth.  
1960_98	1960_98	By 1975 the metropolitan areas of the United States will occupy twice the  territory they do today. The roster of urban problems with which they must  cope is staggering. They involve water supply, cleaning the air, adjusting  local tax systems, providing for essential educational, cultural, and  social services, and destroying those conditions which breed delinquency  and crime.  
1960_100	1960_100	I do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problems can be solved  in the traditional American method. In doing so we must realize that  nothing is really solved and ruinous tendencies are set in motion by  yielding to the deceptive bait of the "easy" Federal tax dollar.  
1960_103	1960_103	But the route to better trained minds is not through the swift  administration of a Federal hypodermic or sustained financial transfusion.  The educational process, essentially a local and personal responsibility,  cannot be made to leap ahead by crash, centralized governmental action.  
1960_111	1960_111	Every minute spent in irrelevant interbranch wrangling is precious time  taken from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policies for  our national survival and progress.  
1960_113	1960_113	Before us and our friends is the challenge of an ideology which, for more  than four decades, has trumpeted abroad its purpose of gaining ultimate  victory over all forms of government at variance with its own.  
1960_114	1960_114	We realize that however much we repudiate the tenets of imperialistic  Communism, it represents a gigantic enterprise grimly pursued by leaders  who compel its subjects to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit  and personal desires for some hoped_for advantage in the future.  
1960_116	1960_116	The competition they provide is formidable.  
1960_118	1960_118	But we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly, regardless of  personal sacrifice.  
1960_119	1960_119	The fissure that divides our political planet is deep and wide.  
1960_121	1960_121	Police states are called "people's democracies."  
1960_122	1960_122	Armed conquest of free people is called "liberation."  
1960_124	1960_124	We must make clear our peaceful intentions, our aspirations for a better  world. So doing, we must use language to enlighten the mind, not as the  instrument of the studied innuendo and distorter of truth.  
1960_128	1960_128	By our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust,  ever mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachments upon  freedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society.  
1961_3	1961_3	I am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wisely  assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; and  a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will  neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold from  neither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, or  future, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and  hazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the  Congress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.  
1961_15	1961_15	I will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve  unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a  self_supporting basis to provide more food for the families of the  unemployed, and to aid their needy children to redevelop our areas of  chronic labor surplus to expand the services of the U.S. Employment  Offices to stimulate housing and construction to secure more purchasing  power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum  wage to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment to increase the  development of our natural resources to encourage price stability and to  take other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for  increased long_range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating  on our weaknesses it is, I hope, a national program to realize our  national strength.  
1961_22	1961_22	In short, we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the  dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce to impose exchange controls to  reduce our anti_recession efforts to fall back on restrictive trade  policies or to weaken our commitments around the world.  
1961_23	1961_23	This Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any  fashion. And this is a commitment.  
1961_24	1961_24	Prudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to  ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world  affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to  pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperative  efforts with our allies will get underway immediately aimed at attracting  foreign investment and travel to this country promoting American exports,  at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and  financing curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending  of private dollars abroad and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharing  with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free  world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the  current deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad  without placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked  to serve our Flag overseas.  
1961_29	1961_29	Our classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have  room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One  third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to  continue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's,  who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 upon  our colleges with two college students for every one, ten years from  now and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the  engineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected  oceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at  the root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school  education can no longer be delayed.  
1961_31	1961_31	Our supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes cost  the taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that we  have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of  constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of  race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience,  and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not  equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business  has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host  of problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to include  in this Message, deserves and will receive the attention of both the  Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages will  be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks.  
1961_33	1961_33	But all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us  around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his  party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be  staggered upon learning even in this brief 10 day period the harsh  enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years.  Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult.  Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread and  hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our  analyses over the last ten days make it clear that in each of the  principal areas of crisis the tide of events has been running out and time  has not been our friend.  
1961_36	1961_36	In Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's  peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles  from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for  a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic  tyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questions  of economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communist  domination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated.  
1961_37	1961_37	We are pledged to work with our sister Republics to free the Americas of  all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of a  free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic  Circle.  
1961_39	1961_39	Our greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold  War but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet  Union and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that  either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination ambitions  which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our  task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be  profitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition for  prestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds is  something else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for  man's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever  increasing confidence.  
1961_41	1961_41	One must not overshadow the other. On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the  American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his left  he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both.  
1961_46	1961_46	(b) I have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program.  Using unobligated ship_building funds now (to let contracts originally  scheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station at  least nine months earlier than planned substantially more units of a  crucial deterrent a fleet that will never attack first, but possess  sufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourage  any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.  
1961_50	1961_50	 more flexibility for short run emergencies  
1961_54	1961_54	To our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for  progress alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin  America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of  economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of  culture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time in  that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:  
1961_57	1961_57	 That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members,  strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent  foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.  
1961_62	1961_62	Finally, while our attention is centered on the development of the non_  communist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom  and welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to  help re_establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress  for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever  this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require  amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I  proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last  summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the  possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that  will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people  of Poland.  
1961_63	1961_63	Third, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools the means of  cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must  ultimately rest.  
1961_69	1961_69	 we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the  Secretary_General is maintained.  
1961_70	1961_70	 And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the  world to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far  more essential to their security than it is to ours the only body in the  world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has  an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to  the strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. It  deserves the support of all.  
1961_71	1961_71	Finally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas  of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations "to invoke the  wonders of science instead of its terrors." Specifically, I now invite all  nations including the Soviet Union to join with us in developing a  weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program and  in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes  which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.  
1961_72	1961_72	Today this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while  the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into  orbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by  removing these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the  Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union  and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits  of this new knowledge available to all and, beyond that, in an effort to  extend farm technology to hungry nations to wipe out disease to increase  the exchanges of scientists and their knowledge and to make our own  laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the  facilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of  us all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even  with those with whom we most deeply disagree and this must someday be the  basis of world peace and world law.  
1961_77	1961_77	We cannot escape our dangers neither must we let them drive us into panic  or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of power  already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply  divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a  harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor  in its servants while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for  privilege, materialism and a life of ease.  
1961_78	1961_78	But I have a different view of liberty.  
1961_80	1961_80	In the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closing  his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, "We pray that we  may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us."  
1962_7	1962_7	At home, we began the year in the valley of recession we completed it on  the high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new Congressionally  approved or Administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the  number of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101 to 60;  non_agricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; and  the average factory work_week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year's  end the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a "stumbling horse" was  racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial  production.  
1962_10	1962_10	(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place  not only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out  of work, but the twenty_six million young Americans entering the labor  market in this decade; and  
1962_18	1962_18	But recession is only one enemy of a free economy inflation is another.  Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held  almost steady and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record of  overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end  of World War II.  
1962_20	1962_20	Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public  spirit of business and labor keeping their total increases in wages and  profits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test to  guide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them for their  country's interest, and for their own to apply the test of the public  interest to these transactions.  
1962_24	1962_24	 We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level  incurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,  
1962_26	1962_26	This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on  appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:  
1962_30	1962_30	III. GETTING AMERICA MOVING  
1962_32	1962_32	CITIES  
1962_35	1962_35	A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American  farmers took heart in 1961 from a billion dollar rise in farm income and  from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are still  operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1  billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural  poverty or boost farm earnings.  
1962_37	1962_37	I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm  program tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop  to the long_range needs of the sixties and designed to prevent chaos in  the sixties with a program of common sense.  
1962_41	1962_41	I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal  employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The Vice  President's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary  "Plans for Progress" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a  quiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional,  supervisory, and other job opportunities.  
1962_42	1962_42	But there is much more to be done by the Executive, by the courts, and by  the Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the  executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of  strengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right to  vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary  devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll  taxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the  Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the  Government and every citizen portray that "righteousness does exalt a  nation."  
1962_45	1962_45	Last year, we improved the diet of needy people provided more hot lunches  and fresh milk to school children built more college dormitories and, for  the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, health services, and  social security. But we have just begun.  
1962_48	1962_48	To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass  immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient  enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.  
1962_54	1962_54	Equally important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight  million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This is  a disturbing figure reflected in Selective Service rejection  rates reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend  plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.  
1962_56	1962_56	If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high  school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet  nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.  Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10  years. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical  levels now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families  earn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs but this Nation  cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.  
1962_57	1962_57	But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent to  the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school  construction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed the  Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount  required by our needs and in terms of across_the_board aid the maximum  scope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken or  withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.  
1962_58	1962_58	"Civilization," said H. G. Wells, "is a race between education and  catastrophe." It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of  that race.  
1962_59	1962_59	These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances  in our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and the  foundation of our hopes. "I believe in democracy," said Woodrow Wilson,  "because it releases the energy of every human being." The dynamic of  democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of  this administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize  his own highest possibilities.  
1962_60	1962_60	Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive  employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational  exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and  welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual  the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of  American life.  
1962_62	1962_62	All of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since the  close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented  mankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of  living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is our  belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.  
1962_64	1962_64	Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and  independent states free to choose their own future and their own system,  so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.  
1962_71	1962_71	V. OUR MILITARY STRENGTH  
1962_75	1962_75	Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's  strategic reserve increased our troops in Europe built up the  Marines added new sealift and airlift capacity modernized our weapons and  ammunition expanded our anti_guerrilla forces and increased the active  fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen  wings.  
1962_77	1962_77	In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised two Army  Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty and  substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the  procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts.  The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way,  identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge your  approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall_out  shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.  
1962_80	1962_80	In 1961 the peace_keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.  And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in  the seat of Hammarskjold or Red China inside the Assembly have seen  instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent  Secretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament   for peace_keeping in outer space for a decade of development effort the  UN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.  
1962_81	1962_81	Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN with  its gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos or certain big_power  confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to  others. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a  united Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.  
1962_82	1962_82	No policeman is universally popular particularly when he uses his stick to  restore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to  contribute their votes and their views but very little else have created  a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments.  Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes and a new  UN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to  be repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly in  our interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all voting  members to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of special  operations has long been much higher than our share of the annual  assessment and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate  obligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our  participation.  
1962_88	1962_88	I turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. The  Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to  program. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of  hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country among  workers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in  speeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin  American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of  self_help and self_reform.  
1962_90	1962_90	VIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS  
1962_92	1962_92	A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in  fourteen countries supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to  give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the  best that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that we  cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.  
1962_94	1962_94	These programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom. The  views of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours but  events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to  write off any nation as lost to the Communists. That is the lesson of our  time. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose  history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside  "entangling alliances" as we did for more than a century. For the  independence of nations is a bar to the Communists' "grand design" it is  the basis of our own.  
1962_98	1962_98	Finally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in  the last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and  the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units both its nuclear and  non_nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are still  required. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe,  immeasurably strengthened.  
1962_102	1962_102	The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new  ties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in  hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of  development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted  diplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic  mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the  accumulating activity of all.  
1962_104	1962_104	X. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  
1962_107	1962_107	We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our  shores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to  maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid  from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which  do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and  to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies so as to  discourage large and disturbing capital movements.  
1962_109	1962_109	Above all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our  exports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive.  Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants our wage and price  gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices our  export credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue  to expand.  
1962_110	1962_110	But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European  Common Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will  arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff  similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we in  this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns or  will we wait until events have passed us by?  
1962_111	1962_111	This is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need a  new law a wholly new approach a bold new instrument of American trade  policy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of  the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to  come.  
1962_115	1962_115	To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new  five_year Trade Expansion Action, far_reaching in scope but designed with  great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any  risks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the  United States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together  supply 80 percent of the world's trade mostly items in which our own  ability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in  these items, substantially more than we import. This step will make it  possible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in  Western Europe for access to European consumers.  
1962_116	1962_116	On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50  percent permitting bargaining by major categories and provide for  appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting  to import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by  peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor are  we abandoning our non_European friends or our traditional "most_favored  nation" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement  for their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our  friends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market,  who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with  them in overcoming.  
1962_117	1962_117	Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not  unilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless  its outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity in  our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together we  face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men  everywhere to build in partnership a new trading community in which all  free nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive  effort.  
1963_2	1963_2	I congratulate you all not merely on your electoral victory but on your  selected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the great  Republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history. The  choices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union for  generations yet to come.  
1963_3	1963_3	Little more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the  United States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I  pledged no easy answers. I pledged and asked only toil and dedication.  These the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today,  having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national  purpose and power having seen the courageous calm of a united people in  a perilous hour and having observed a steady improvement in the  opportunities and well_being of our citizens I can report to you that  the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life,  is good.  
1963_4	1963_4	In the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in building  a world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure. A  settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos. The  spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet_Nam. The end of agony may  be in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead. And, while danger  continues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.  
1963_7	1963_7	But we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill, not  the top. The mere absence of war is not peace. The mere absence of  recession is not growth. We have made a beginning but we have only begun.  
1963_11	1963_11	For this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in  production, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end to  the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent  for 61 out of the past 62 months and an end to the growing pressures for  such restrictive measures as the 35_hour week, which alone could increase  hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage_price spiral  of inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations.  
1963_13	1963_13	For it is increasingly clear to those in Government, business, and labor  who are responsible for our economy's success that our obsolete tax system  exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and  employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks  growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts the use  of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal  revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.  
1963_16	1963_16	To achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary  deficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years,  beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second,  that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes,  beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or  unnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the  net offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetary  receipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without any  change in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of large  corporations to a more current time schedule. This combined program, by  increasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in still  higher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally responsible program the surest  and the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced  full employment economy.  
1963_18	1963_18	I do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to  achieve these goals.  
1963_21	1963_21	No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone  would be of great help but corporations need customers and job seekers  need jobs.  
1963_23	1963_23	And finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax  cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible  an equivalent cut in expenditures but that end is not in view and to wait  for it would be costly and self_defeating.  
1963_26	1963_26	II.  
1963_30	1963_30	Therefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep  within the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative to  adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone.  
1963_38	1963_38	Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if  we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, and  nurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban  hospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and  dentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years  increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental  schools by 100 percent.  
1963_40	1963_40	Third, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights of  its citizens.  
1963_41	1963_41	The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of  crime in Federal court, regardless of his means.  
1963_43	1963_43	Fourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most  economical use of its resources and facilities.  
1963_48	1963_48	We shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach  abroad. Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help  them half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponents  could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much  as a chronic, lagging U.S. economy. These domestic tasks do not divert  energy from our security they provide the very foundation for freedom's  survival and success.  
1963_53	1963_53	Four special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, the  developing nations, the new Sino_Soviet difficulties, and the search for  worldwide peace.  
1963_55	1963_55	First, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a new  phase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion has  passed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of  interdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies of  Marx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nations  of Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in  every sphere of activity.  
1963_56	1963_56	For 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both political  and economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcome  partner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and freedom is still  long, and there are burdens which only full partners can share in  supporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning our  balance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concerting  political and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effort  other industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic and  political development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the world  scene a major constructive role.  
1963_60	1963_60	We remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full  realization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for the  first time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to  become a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.  
1963_65	1963_65	Nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or  subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in  daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little sense  for us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, to  spend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance and then to  begrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one_tenth of  that amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure  the social chaos in which communism has always thrived.  
1963_69	1963_69	I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort  among our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, working  in close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality.  Today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in Latin  America an extra food ration from our farm surplus. It has distributed 1.5  million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms. It has helped  resettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their  own. It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self_help and  self_reform fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms. It is  bringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who were  forgotten. The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance  cannot succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts that  it can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote their  best effort to fulfilling its goals.  
1963_70	1963_70	This story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Wherever  nations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them build  new bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; we  have gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike. What  we do ask and all that we ask is that our help be used to best advantage,  and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other  independent nations.  
1963_71	1963_71	Despite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the Mutual  Assistance Program requires a persistent discontent with present  performance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more  effective, efficient instrument and that process will continue this year.  
1963_73	1963_73	Neither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon  against poverty. In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose,  requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothing  carries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far  corners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.  
1963_75	1963_75	There are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and  the cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match.  Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; by  supporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to foreign visitors and  diplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well as  word, that we are a just and generous people.  
1963_78	1963_78	Nevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forces  of diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the iron  disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology. Marx  is proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, not  the free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of  internal disintegration.  
1963_80	1963_80	New nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare  conditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North and  South Viet_Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of Communist  Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all the world knows  that no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom  out and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communist  failure.  
1963_81	1963_81	VII.  
1963_84	1963_84	But it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil  defense, a strengthened anti_guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance,  more powerful and flexible non_nuclear forces. For threats of massive  retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression and a line of destroyers in  a quarantine, or a division of well_equipped men on a border, may be more  useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons  beyond all rational need.  
1963_90	1963_90	To achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater  portion of its national production than any other people in the free world.  For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself. Through  hot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages of  the atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and their  faith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem to make life  difficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult  for us all.  
1963_91	1963_91	But difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and memorable  days in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for example, of Major  Rudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba. We salute  Specialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea. We  pay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet_Nam. They are  among the many who in this century, far from home, have died for our  country. Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to their  commitment.  
1964_9	1964_9	Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy not  because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.  
1964_11	1964_11	For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and  honest and frugal. The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in  full accord with this pledge.  
1964_12	1964_12	It will cut our deficit in half from $10 billion to $4,900 million. It  will be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since  1951.  
1964_15	1964_15	But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand  still. Our population is growing. Our economy is more complex. Our people's  needs are expanding.  
1964_17	1964_17	This budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help each  and every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes his hopes for a fair  chance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a  full_time job on full_time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family  in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with  good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or  unemployment or old age. III.  
1964_20	1964_20	It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will  suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on  earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand  dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return  $40,000 or more in his lifetime.  
1964_23	1964_23	The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to  help that one_fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even  meet their basic needs.  
1964_27	1964_27	Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and,  above all, to prevent it. No single piece of legislation, however, is going  to suffice.  
1964_34	1964_34	We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million  workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.  
1964_38	1964_38	We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give  more help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for  our poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free  enterprise system a decent home for every American family.  
1964_41	1964_41	These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.  Every American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover  the hospital costs of their aged parents. Every American community will  benefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries,  hospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the  improvement of urban renewal in public transit. And every individual  American taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the  earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new  investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.  
1964_42	1964_42	That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year. Now we need action.  The new budget clearly allows it. Our taxpayers surely deserve it. Our  economy strongly demands it. And every month of delay dilutes its benefits  in 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment.  
1964_44	1964_44	I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the  first of February, if at all possible. For however proud we may be of the  unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3  years, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.  
1964_45	1964_45	In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job mark,  but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs. In 1963 our gross national  product reached the $600 billion level $100 billion higher than when we  took office. But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher  today than it is.  
1964_51	1964_51	All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to  the public. All members of the public should be equally eligible for  Federal benefits that are financed by the public. All members of the public  should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their  children to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the  public good.  
1964_53	1964_53	We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those  who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed  skills and those joining their families.  
1964_57	1964_57	First, we must maintain and our reduced defense budget will maintain that  margin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of  steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our  conventional, and our antiguerilla forces. In 1964 we will be better  prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is  threatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those  in Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to  foment insurrection. And we must continue to use that strength as John  Kennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty to  demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of  lasting peace.  
1964_66	1964_66	Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to  develop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby  frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos. To do this, the rich must  help the poor and we must do our part. We must achieve a more rigorous  administration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private  investors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies  and for the recipient nations themselves.  
1965_1	1965_1	On this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships.  
1965_2	1965_2	Though total agreement between the Executive and the Congress is  impossible, total respect is important.  
1965_4	1965_4	I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body  tonight.  
1965_5	1965_5	Twenty_eight years ago, I felt as you do now. You will soon learn that you  are among men whose first love is their country, men who try each day to do  as best they can what they believe is right.  
1965_7	1965_7	Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined  together to demand freedom from arbitrary power.  
1965_8	1965_8	For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental  union of democracy in the history of man. One hundred years ago, in 1865,  following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was  finally sealed.  
1965_10	1965_10	That struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over. But  we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in  the history of freedom.  
1965_14	1965_14	But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in  isolation. For today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon  the state of the world.  
1965_17	1965_17	Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this. For in concert with  other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom.  
1965_21	1965_21	Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American  dream.  
1965_26	1965_26	In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our  neighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward  economic growth and political democracy.  
1965_30	1965_30	No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay.  We know that history is ours to make. And if there is great danger, there  is now also the excitement of great expectations.  
1965_32	1965_32	Yet we still live in a troubled and  perilous world. There is no longer a single threat. There are many. They  differ in intensity and in danger. They require different attitudes and  different answers.  
1965_38	1965_38	In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their  identity. Your Government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and  business, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these  countries and with the Soviet Union. I will report our conclusions to the  Congress.  
1965_41	1965_41	Second, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia. Twice in one  generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East. To  ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war.  
1965_43	1965_43	What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will  never be found wanting.  
1965_46	1965_46	With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt and my country  has always felt very special ties of interest and affection. It will be  the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties. Together we  share and shape the destiny of the new world. In the coming year I hope to  pay a visit to Latin America. And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to  the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and  injustice in this hemisphere.  
1965_48	1965_48	This European policy is not based on any abstract design. It is based on  the realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and  common expectations. These realities will continue to have their  way especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our  common defense.  
1965_50	1965_50	Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe. And, for the same reasons,  that course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the interest of  freedom.  
1965_51	1965_51	I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last  year. I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this  year.  
1965_53	1965_53	We welcome them to the society of nations.  
1965_54	1965_54	We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own  independence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to  the welfare of all of their people.  
1965_57	1965_57	Finally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the  effectiveness of the United Nations. The frustrations of the United Nations  are a product of the world that we live in, and not of the institution  which gives them voice. It is far better to throw these differences open to  the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger.  
1965_59	1965_59	For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor  obedience.  
1965_63	1965_63	For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that  we mean for all men to ultimately have.  
1965_64	1965_64	TOWARD THE GREAT SOCIETY  
1965_65	1965_65	World affairs will continue to call upon our energy  and our courage.  
1965_66	1965_66	But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American  life.  
1965_77	1965_77	And like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not fulfillment.  And tonight we accept that challenge.  
1965_80	1965_80	I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing  diseases.  
1965_81	1965_81	I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a  better and a more stimulating place to live.  
1965_83	1965_83	I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country  that are now suffering from distress and depression.  
1965_86	1965_86	I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the  creations of art.  
1965_87	1965_87	I propose that we make an all_out campaign against waste and inefficiency.  
1965_90	1965_90	First, to keep our economy growing;  
1965_91	1965_91	 to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most  Americans;  
1965_95	1965_95	1. A GROWING ECONOMY  
1965_97	1965_97	First, we must keep our Nation prosperous. We seek full  employment opportunity for every American citizen. I will present a budget  designed to move the economy forward. More money will be left in the hands  of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes. We will continue  along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.  
1965_102	1965_102	Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of  American business. But we stand ready with credit and other help to  assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire Nation.  
1965_103	1965_103	ON THE FARMS  
1965_105	1965_105	INCREASED PROSPERITY  
1965_108	1965_108	 further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern  technology, for the laboring_man is an indispensable force in the American  system;  
1965_110	1965_110	 the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation  system.  
1965_111	1965_111	And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose to  Congress changes in the Taft_Hartley Act including section 14(b). I will do  so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided  Americans in various States of our Union.  
1965_112	1965_112	In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to  continued growth.  
1965_113	1965_113	TRANSPORTATION FOR GROWTH  
1965_115	1965_115	I will ask for funds to study high_speed rail transportation between urban  centers. We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston. On  high_speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in less than 4  hours.  
1965_116	1965_116	II. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL  
1965_126	1965_126	THROUGH EDUCATION  
1965_127	1965_127	We begin with learning.  
1965_130	1965_130	In addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for  schools and students with a first year authorization of $1,500 million.  
1965_132	1965_132	For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the  excitement of learning.  
1965_135	1965_135	New laboratories and centers will help our schools help them lift their  standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching. These centers  will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve  special treatment.  
1965_136	1965_136	THROUGH BETTER HEALTH  
1965_138	1965_138	Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of  our people.  
1965_142	1965_142	Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for  school_age children from poor families, including services for the mentally  retarded.  
1965_144	1965_144	The City  
1965_152	1965_152	 to train local law enforcement officers;  
1965_153	1965_153	 to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal;  
1965_158	1965_158	Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and  to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation.  
1965_165	1965_165	To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress, I  will recommend programs to encourage basic science, particularly in the  universities and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our  growing need for fresh water.  
1965_169	1965_169	Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the  National Government.  
1965_170	1965_170	And I intend to do better this year.  
1965_171	1965_171	And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies  that your Government plans to make.  
1965_172	1965_172	Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.  
1965_176	1965_176	This year I speak after 1 year as President of the United States.  
1965_177	1965_177	Many of you in this Chamber are among my oldest friends. We have shared  many happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many  Presidents together. Yet, only in the White House can you finally know the  full weight of this Office.  
1965_181	1965_181	The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.  
1965_184	1965_184	And tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and  goats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are  gone.  
1965_186	1965_186	Well, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on. But  there was more than that. There was a dream a dream of a place where a  free man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better  life a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a nation  to be made.  
1965_193	1965_193	It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I have  tried, in part, to do tonight.  
1965_195	1965_195	This, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and full  of hope.  
1966_7	1966_7	I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full  vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law  last year.  
1966_10	1966_10	I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United  States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  
1966_11	1966_11	I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before  attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in  America.  
1966_14	1966_14	I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all  of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and  State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct  public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing  discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.  
1966_30	1966_30	Workers are making more money than ever with after_tax income in the past  5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.  
1966_32	1966_32	Corporations have greater after_tax earnings than ever in history. For the  past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year  alone they had a rise of 20 percent.  
1966_34	1966_34	I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the  Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of  payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3  billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the  patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with  your Government.  
1966_35	1966_35	We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance  of payments deficit altogether in the next year.  
1966_38	1966_38	I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of Vietnam  require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional  appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.  
1966_43	1966_43	To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will  plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community  Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps  teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and  available medical resources.  
1966_45	1966_45	And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without  improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively  to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national  interest.  
1966_46	1966_46	Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that  shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks  oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and  which individual abundance alone will not overcome.  
1966_47	1966_47	We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to  our lives if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change  old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear  enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people.  
1966_48	1966_48	This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.  
1966_49	1966_49	Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last  year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our  Armed Forces.  
1966_53	1966_53	Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really  more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air.  
1966_56	1966_56	Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their  streets and that right just must be secured.  
1966_59	1966_59	We must also act to prevent the deception of the American  consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their  contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping  harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.  
1966_60	1966_60	It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring  institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich  fertility of American political invention. We must change to master  change.  
1966_71	1966_71	In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could  bring decay and even disaster.  
1966_74	1966_74	In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have  extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the  largest program of economic assistance in the world.  
1966_75	1966_75	And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of  social justice.  
1966_76	1966_76	In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea  under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President  Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam.  
1966_77	1966_77	Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world  problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss  them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing  lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents.  
1966_83	1966_83	From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested  on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people  advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.  
1966_85	1966_85	We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease  and ignorance.  
1966_86	1966_86	We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great  America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries  committed to develop a modern agriculture.  
1966_88	1966_88	I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at  disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the  uncared_for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out  smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during  this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by  increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts.  
1966_99	1966_99	That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of  our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba and tonight in  Vietnam.  
1966_100	1966_100	For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young  Americans die in a distant land.  
1966_103	1966_103	Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that  the security and the freedom of this Nation required.  
1966_104	1966_104	And they do again tonight in Vietnam. Not too many years ago Vietnam was a  peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist  government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the  friendly help of the United States.  
1966_106	1966_106	As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave,  abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we  could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We stayed.  
1966_107	1966_107	And we will stay until aggression has stopped.  
1966_114	1966_114	The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side.  There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.  
1966_118	1966_118	Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more  than 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all  113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't. We have talked to  the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any  contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.  
1966_120	1966_120	We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military  alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self_determination that  the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course,  choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without  fear.  
1966_121	1966_121	The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question  of reunification.  
1966_123	1966_123	We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no  arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements  of 1954 and 1962. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any  proposals four points or fourteen or forty and we will consider the views  of any group. We will work for a cease_fire now or once discussions have  begun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will  withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right  to shape its own future.  
1966_128	1966_128	I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this  conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future  may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard  conference, or even both at once.  
1966_129	1966_129	Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act  as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South  Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither  increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.  
1966_132	1966_132	And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months  may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to  battle.  
1966_134	1966_134	The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared  needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to  build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of  battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own  destiny. For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent  peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.  
1966_136	1966_136	To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight:  Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond  that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the  servant of life.  
1966_140	1966_140	How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other  wars? How very many are not here to listen?  
1966_147	1966_147	The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with  whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our  mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth.  
1967_8	1967_8	As President Abraham Lincoln said, "We must ask where we are, and whither  we are tending." I.  
1967_9	1967_9	The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better  country.  
1967_12	1967_12	We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.  Three and one_half million Americans have already received treatment under  Medicare since July.  
1967_14	1967_14	We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum  wage.  
1967_15	1967_15	We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1  million Americans.  
1967_17	1967_17	We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the  Neighborhood Youth Corps or through Head Start, a chance to learn.  
1967_18	1967_18	So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have  succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now we  must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress,  or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been abandoned  now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.  
1967_19	1967_19	I believe that our people do not want to quit though the task is great,  the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or  months, but of years and sometimes it may be even decades. II.  
1967_22	1967_22	Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social  progress. This required trial and error and it has produced both. But as  we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we  are trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these starts some  rewarding, others inadequate and disappointing are crucial to SUCCESS.  
1967_25	1967_25	Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few  understood what was required and did anything about it. The executive  branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action  on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President  presented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me  in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, "It will not be a short  or easy struggle no single weapon... will suffice but we shall not rest  until that war is won."  
1967_26	1967_26	And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.  
1967_33	1967_33	I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different  reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this  Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.  
1967_36	1967_36	This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program  will be thoroughly evaluated. Grant_in_aid programs will be improved and  simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our  Governors.  
1967_41	1967_41	Federal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working  partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The  test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization,  each private institution, and each responsible citizen.  
1967_42	1967_42	Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government  in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and  as I see you are examining yours. Some will need to reorganize and reshape  their methods of administration as we are doing. Others will need to revise  their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date as we are  doing. Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the  multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more  efficiently.  
1967_43	1967_43	During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments  about $40 billion in grants_in_aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our  Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the  State and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and local  governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually. These  enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively. We intend to  work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.  
1967_48	1967_48	We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years  old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the  early years.  
1967_51	1967_51	Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their  Nation's progress.  
1967_55	1967_55	We should embark upon a major effort to provide self_help assistance to the  forgotten in our midst the American Indians and the migratory farm  workers. And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those  who live in rural poverty.  
1967_58	1967_58	We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the  landmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort, this year,  the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.  
1967_61	1967_61	We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for  a beautiful America to dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our  cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and  more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that  come after us to enjoy.  
1967_63	1967_63	We should modernize our Selective Service System. The National Commission  on Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will send you new  recommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But let us resolve  that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as  effective as possible.  
1967_64	1967_64	We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the "right most valued by  civilized men" the right to privacy. We should outlaw all  wiretapping public and private wherever and whenever it occurs, except  when the security of this Nation itself is at stake and only then with the  strictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full reach of  our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic "bugging" and "snooping."  
1967_71	1967_71	The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the  Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the  National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the  best ways to carry that attack forward.  
1967_77	1967_77	 90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master  plans, to combat crime in their area;  
1967_78	1967_78	 60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant  communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest  equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on  crime;  
1967_82	1967_82	Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have  already been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but "every  beginning is a consequence." If we postpone this urgent work now, it will  simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.  
1967_87	1967_87	 Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;  
1967_91	1967_91	Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to  avoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no  pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.  
1967_92	1967_92	Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive  rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very  severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders,  and all those associated with the home industry.  
1967_94	1967_94	As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale  prices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food  prices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have  retreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available.  
1967_95	1967_95	Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly  seek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge the American  people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest  rates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board  tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to  savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from  6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.  
1967_96	1967_96	We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that  we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals;  that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the  progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement  in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and  toward lower interest rates.  
1967_100	1967_100	For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And with  the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate  revenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.  
1967_104	1967_104	Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the  quality of life for every American not just the rich, not just the poor,  but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.  
1967_106	1967_106	We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this  country in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we  are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand  up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.  III.  
1967_107	1967_107	Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at home,  there is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign policy is  so sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be flexible where  conditions in the world change and where man's efforts can change them for  the better.  
1967_108	1967_108	We are in the midst of a great transition a transition from narrow  nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold  war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened  planet.  
1967_111	1967_111	Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America. It has  yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above  all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible. There,  too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa  cooperate on a regional basis. More and more our programs for Africa are  going to be directed toward self_help.  
1967_125	1967_125	We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another  2 years.  
1967_126	1967_126	We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to  embassies.  
1967_128	1967_128	This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to  fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world  that were entered into before I became President.  
1967_130	1967_130	The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long_range missile  capabilities. It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile  defense. My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation  can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear  power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.  
1967_132	1967_132	I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the  Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing  directly upon this problem.  
1967_133	1967_133	Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human  family is the race between food supply and population increase. That race  tonight is being lost.  
1967_134	1967_134	The time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action is  here and we must get on with the job.  
1967_136	1967_136	First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food  production, including the use of technology and the capital of private  enterprise.  
1967_137	1967_137	Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into  voluntary family planning programs.  
1967_143	1967_143	We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to  remain non_Communist if that is what they choose as North Vietnam has to  remain Communist.  
1967_144	1967_144	We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all  necessary measures to prevent further aggression.  
1967_145	1967_145	No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by  the great Thomas Jefferson:  
1967_150	1967_150	Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression this  time it was in Korea. Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had  failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south. The  Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as  we said 16 years ago in Korea: "This far and no further."  
1967_152	1967_152	I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over. This I  cannot do. We face more cost, more loss, and more agony. For the end is not  yet. I cannot promise you that it will come this year or come next year.  Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting  longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to  stand up and resist.  
1967_154	1967_154	So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained and will be  sustained until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more  than he can ever gain.  
1967_155	1967_155	I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of  "accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resource" of  "laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade." That, and  patience and I mean a great deal of patience.  
1967_156	1967_156	Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight. Because they  must provide real security to the people living in the countryside. And  this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and  killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be  successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces. It  means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they  can respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in,  and that they can have a personal stake in. We hope that government is now  beginning to emerge.  
1967_157	1967_157	While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the  very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that  South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency. We can  help, but only they can win this part of the war. Their task is to build  and protect a new life in each rural province.  
1967_158	1967_158	One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.  
1967_160	1967_160	The performance of our men in Vietnam backed by the American people has  created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of  Asia and the Pacific. I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent  in their homes and in their countries. Fear of external Communist conquest  in many Asian nations is already subsiding and with this, the spirit of  hope is rising. For the first time in history, a common outlook and common  institutions are already emerging.  
1967_162	1967_162	Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of  the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the  Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are  already open. Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new  directions. Their hopes are high. Their faith is strong. Their confidence  is deep.  
1967_164	1967_164	We are eager to turn our resources to peace. Our efforts in behalf of  humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary  line. The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask  the Congress for funds to join in an international program of  reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam and their  deserving neighbors who wish our help.  
1967_167	1967_167	Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that  we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam  through to an honorable peace.  
1967_173	1967_173	The answers will determine not only where we are, but "whither we are  tending."  
1967_175	1967_175	But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live  with it for a long time yet to come. We know that "man is born unto  trouble." We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive  and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many  men.  
1967_180	1967_180	Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been  found wanting.  
1968_2	1968_2	I was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam Rayburn  told me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm welcome to  the President as he comes in.  
1968_5	1968_5	I report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad:  
1968_7	1968_7	 that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical  strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the  moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world.  
1968_9	1968_9	Since I reported to you last January:  
1968_11	1968_11	 A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village officials  have been chosen by popular, contested ballot.  
1968_15	1968_15	 The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into  battle, despite his continuous heavy losses.  
1968_19	1968_19	We believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I  stated last September, which said:  
1968_21	1968_21	 And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have  in the past. This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without  jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.  
1968_22	1968_22	If a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio  foundations and it is my hope and my prayer that they can we would  consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete  cessation of hostilities a really true cease_fire could be made the first  order of business. I will report at the earliest possible moment the  results of these explorations to the American people.  
1968_29	1968_29	These events we all welcomed. Yet since I last reported to you, we and the  world have been confronted by a number of crises:  
1968_30	1968_30	 During the Arab_Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington  and Moscow was used for the first time in our history. A cease_fire was  achieved without a major power confrontation.  
1968_31	1968_31	Now the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate with  Ambassador Jarring's U.N. mission and they have the responsibility to find  the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we shall do  all in our power to help them achieve that result.  
1968_34	1968_34	Since I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have  taken several important steps toward the goal of international  cooperation.  
1968_35	1968_35	As you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we  achieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our respective  positions after 2 days of meeting.  
1968_39	1968_39	But despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is  capable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the  mode of aggression. Our choices must not be confined to total war or to  total acquiescence.  
1968_40	1968_40	We have such a military force today. We shall maintain it.  
1968_41	1968_41	I wish with all of my heart that the expenditures that are necessary to  build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of  peace. But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured,  America's might and America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's  uniform must continue to stand guard for all of us as they gallantly do  tonight in Vietnam and other places in the world.  
1968_42	1968_42	Yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions  of peace.  
1968_45	1968_45	 That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the  International Development Association, and to increase the resources of the  Asian Development Bank.  
1968_47	1968_47	 That we renew and extend the food for freedom program.  
1968_48	1968_48	Our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of  famine.  
1968_52	1968_52	Let me speak now about some matters here at home.  
1968_58	1968_58	Why, then, this restlessness?  
1968_59	1968_59	Because when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always  stirred and troubled.  
1968_60	1968_60	And our ship is moving. It is moving through troubled and new waters; it is  moving toward new and better shores.  
1968_66	1968_66	 Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and  parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hope not an  achievement.  
1968_67	1968_67	 New housing construction is far less than we need to assure decent  shelter for every family.  
1968_68	1968_68	 Hospital and medical costs are high, and they are rising.  
1968_69	1968_69	 Many rivers and the air in many cities remain badly polluted. And our  citizens suffer from breathing that air.  
1968_70	1968_70	We have lived with conditions like these for many, many years. But much  that we once accepted as inevitable, we now find absolutely intolerable.  
1968_73	1968_73	But the issue is not whether we can change this; the issue is whether we  will change this.  
1968_74	1968_74	Well, I know we can. And I believe we will.  
1968_75	1968_75	This then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in  this Congress.  
1968_79	1968_79	This year, the time has come when we must get to those who are last in  line the hard_core unemployed the hardest to reach.  
1968_81	1968_81	To do this, I propose a $2. 1 billion manpower program in the coming fiscal  year a 25 percent increase over the current year. Most of this increase  will be used to start a new partnership between government and private  industry to train and to hire the hard_core unemployed persons. I know of  no task before us of more importance to us, to the country, or to our  future.  
1968_83	1968_83	Last year the Congress authorized $662 million for the Model Cities  program. I requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet the  crisis in the cities of America. But the Congress appropriated only $312  million less than half.  
1968_87	1968_87	Therefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor, to  start building 300,000 housing units for low_ and middle_income families  next year that is three times more than this year. We must make it  possible for thousands of families to become homeowners, not rent_payers.  
1968_92	1968_92	But it is a shocking fact that, in saving the lives of babies, America  ranks 15th among the nations of the world. And among children, crippling  defects are often discovered too late for any corrective action. This is a  tragedy that Americans can, and Americans should, prevent.  
1968_96	1968_96	Last year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive branch  moved in that field.  
1968_98	1968_98	And now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work. The  Senate has already passed the truth_in_lending bill, the fire safety bill,  and the pipeline safety laws.  
1968_100	1968_100	I also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the House  to guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity exchange  market.  
1968_101	1968_101	These measures are a pledge to our people to keep them safe in their homes  and at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace.  
1968_103	1968_103	 New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud and  who swindle our public.  
1968_109	1968_109	So let us get on with the work. Let us act soon.  
1968_113	1968_113	But the people also recognize that the National Government can and the  National Government should help the cities and the States in their war on  crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority.  And this we shall do.  
1968_118	1968_118	There is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the Safe  Streets Act this year that I proposed last year. That law will provide  these required funds. They are so critically needed that I have doubled my  request under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.  
1968_120	1968_120	This year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter penalties  for those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people.  
1968_122	1968_122	I ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more. These young men will  give special attention to this drug abuse, too.  
1968_124	1968_124	A moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where  the fires of disorder burned last summer. We can and in time we  will change that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations  into achievements. But violence will never bring progress.  
1968_128	1968_128	I shall recommend other actions:  
1968_130	1968_130	 I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for  fair prices.  
1968_131	1968_131	 I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures.  
1968_136	1968_136	 I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive to  break down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from  college.  
1968_139	1968_139	Next month we'll begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity. The  economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth if we are vigilant.  
1968_143	1968_143	We those of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the leaders  of labor and business must do everything we can to prevent that kind of  misfortune.  
1968_148	1968_148	Now, this is a tight budget. It follows the reduction that I made in  cooperation with the Congress a reduction made after you had reviewed  every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or $6  billion and expenditures by $1.5 billion. We conferred together and I  recommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent  from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures. We therefore  reduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and expenditures  over $4 billion. Now, that was in the budget last year.  
1968_151	1968_151	 to act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which  for the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each  dollar's income.  
1968_153	1968_153	This must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years.  Congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed. But Congress can  never repeal inflation.  
1968_157	1968_157	Americans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4 billion  out of their country last year in travel costs. We must try to reduce the  travel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion. We are hoping that we  can reduce it by $500 million without unduly penalizing the travel of  teachers, students, business people who have essential and necessary  travel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see. Even  with this reduction of $500 million, the American people will still be  traveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or any other  year in their history.  
1968_166	1968_166	Of course we can if we will.  
1968_170	1968_170	So this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building, tested  many times in this past year and always equal to the test.  
1968_171	1968_171	Thank you and good night.  
1969_1	1969_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress and my fellow  Americans:  
1969_7	1969_7	 our economy,  
1969_9	1969_9	 our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful  flight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride,  
1969_10	1969_10	 the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, and  
1969_13	1969_13	Unfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end of  the problems that this administration has faced. The effort to meet the  problems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have all  mounted together in these past years is not to be lost.  
1969_24	1969_24	These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and,  finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.  
1969_28	1969_28	They express America's common determination to achieve goals. They imply  action.  
1969_34	1969_34	Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of  their growing populations. So I believe an urban development bank should be  created by the Congress. This bank could obtain resources through the  issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced  rates to the communities throughout the land for schools, hospitals, parks,  and other public facilities.  
1969_35	1969_35	Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has  recognized the necessity to "make more adequate provision for aged persons  . . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health." Those  are the words of the Congress "more adequate."  
1969_36	1969_36	The time has come, I think, to make it more adequate. I believe we should  increase social security benefits, and I am so recommending tonight.  
1969_40	1969_40	I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of  catastrophic illness.  
1969_41	1969_41	As we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress  than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty. Congress  expressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: "It is the policy of  the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of  plenty in this nation."  
1969_43	1969_43	I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of  the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to  other agencies. I believe, though, it will want to continue, until we have  broken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making throughout this  land.  
1969_44	1969_44	I believe, and I hope the next administration I believe they believe that  the key to success in this effort is jobs. It is work for people who want  to work.  
1969_46	1969_46	The Nation's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the  Declaration of Independence. They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and 15th  amendments. They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of  three far_reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that this  Congress, in its wisdom, passed.  
1969_47	1969_47	On January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20  million American homes and apartments. The prohibition against racial  discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously  enforced throughout this land.  
1969_52	1969_52	I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order  in the United States. I hope these grants can be made to the States and  they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country.  
1969_54	1969_54	Frankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest  disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and  registration act for firearms. I think if we had passed that act, it would  have reduced the incidence of crime. I believe that the Congress should  adopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant date.  
1969_56	1969_56	[Footnote 1: Frederick R. Kappel, Chairman of the Commission on Executive,  Legislative and Judicial Salaries.]  
1969_57	1969_57	I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an  unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve  their country.  
1969_60	1969_60	I would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the advice  that I received from the leadership and you usually are consulted about  matters that affect the Congress was that the Congress would not accept  the $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be  seriously considered, I should make substantial reductions. That is the  only reason I didn't go along with the Kappel report.  
1969_61	1969_61	In 1967 I recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection  system for the draft. I submit it again tonight for your most respectful  consideration.  
1969_63	1969_63	We have already been able to increase our support for major social  programs although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything  on the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last  5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education  from $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year. That is  more than double. That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188  years of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam.  
1969_64	1969_64	We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a  way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.  
1969_65	1969_65	Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last  year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January  when we made our estimates. At that time, you will remember that we  estimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion. Well, I am glad to report  to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are  going to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.4 billion  surplus.  
1969_69	1969_69	Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will  bring an early peace to Vietnam. And if our hopes for an early settlement  of the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and  very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable  purposes, as the Congress may determine.  
1969_72	1969_72	I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the  Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have  achieved a surplus. It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year  than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957.  
1969_73	1969_73	The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration  since the end of World War II. It has required us to seek a limitation of  arms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as  well. We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty  of 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968.  
1969_74	1969_74	This latter agreement the nonproliferation treaty is now pending in the  Senate and it has been pending there since last July. In my opinion, delay  in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace. America  took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps  to have it approved at the earliest possible date.  
1969_76	1969_76	It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to  aid the developing nations. We knew then that we could not live in good  conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.  
1969_79	1969_79	The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role  that its resources permit is to go forward to unity. I think America  remains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the  basis of equality.  
1969_80	1969_80	For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:  
1969_84	1969_84	The strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist  power has not ended especially in the light of the brutal invasion of  Czechoslovakia. But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are  able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world  catastrophe.  
1969_85	1969_85	What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world. We earnestly hope  that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and  individual freedom.  
1969_87	1969_87	I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore  peace to South Vietnam.  
1969_89	1969_89	The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that  America cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America's own  vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.  
1969_91	1969_91	I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal  tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us. I  have been honored to be their Commander in Chief. The Nation owes them its  unstinting support while the battle continues and its enduring gratitude  when their service is done.  
1969_95	1969_95	I did that for two reasons. One was philosophical. I wanted to give you my  judgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view  them, before I leave.  
1969_96	1969_96	The other was just pure sentimental. Most all of my life as a public  official has been spent here in this building. For 38 years since I worked  on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives I have  known these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked  them.  
1969_101	1969_101	Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative  democracy a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an  employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.  
1969_102	1969_102	I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation described by the  Constitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given  life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow  citizens.  
1969_110	1969_110	That is what I hope. But I believe that at least it will be said that we  tried.  
1970_3	1970_3	The State of the Union Address is traditionally an occasion for a lengthy  and detailed account by the President of what he has accomplished in the  past, what he wants the Congress to do in the future, and, in an election  year, to lay the basis for the political issues which might be decisive in  the fall.  
1970_6	1970_6	The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this  land to the creation of a new American experience, an experience richer and  deeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human  spirit.  
1970_8	1970_8	Our land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land. It  is also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is the  summons of the seventies.  
1970_9	1970_9	It is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing our  Nation which are above partisanship.  
1970_10	1970_10	When we speak of America's priorities the first priority must always be  peace for America and the world.  
1970_11	1970_11	The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the  war in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered not so much  as the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we had  the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next  generation was able to keep.  
1970_23	1970_23	Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively  or primarily an American undertaking.  
1970_26	1970_26	To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from  responsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.  
1970_29	1970_29	We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with  those nations as partners rather than patrons.  
1970_35	1970_35	Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a  catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement  of our differences.  
1970_39	1970_39	The critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use that  growth.  
1970_42	1970_42	Ours has become as it continues to be, and should remain a society of  large expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. It  undertook to meet them. Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so.  
1970_43	1970_43	As a people, we had too many visions and too little vision.  
1970_45	1970_45	Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the  programs of the past. The time has come for a new quest a quest not for a  greater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life in  America.  
1970_47	1970_47	I will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this  session.  
1970_50	1970_50	Second, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of  government at the Federal, State, and local level. It is time for a New  Federalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the people and  local and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will begin to flow from  Washington back to the States and to the people of the United States.  
1970_52	1970_52	I could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for  health, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical areas  which directly affect the well_being of millions of Americans.  
1970_54	1970_54	When I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American people, I  can think of none more important than for the Congress to join this  administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living.  
1970_58	1970_58	In that same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit in  price increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of  four by $200 per month in America.  
1970_63	1970_63	It is time to quit putting good money into bad programs. Otherwise, we will  end up with bad money and bad programs.  
1970_64	1970_64	I recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and particularly  in an election year. But unless we stop the rise in prices, the cost of  living for millions of American families will become unbearable and  government's ability to plan programs for progress for the future will  become impossible.  
1970_68	1970_68	Last year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces of  legislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime,  narcotics, crime in the District of Columbia.  
1970_73	1970_73	The primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local  and State rather than with Federal Government. But in the field of  organized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has a  special responsibility it should fulfill. And we should make Washington,  D.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nation  and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness.  
1970_76	1970_76	Or does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this place  will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in  metropolitan areas choked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned by  water, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?  
1970_79	1970_79	Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond  factions. It has become a common cause of all the people of this country.  It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they more  than we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs  which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later.  
1970_82	1970_82	The program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive and  costly program in this field in America's history.  
1970_84	1970_84	I shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean waters  program to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in  America where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do it  now. We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them all  within 5 years. This program will get them built within 5 years.  
1970_86	1970_86	The automobile is our worst polluter of the air. Adequate control requires  further advances in engine design and fuel composition. We shall intensify  our research, set increasingly strict standards, and strengthen enforcement  procedures and we shall do it now.  
1970_89	1970_89	Now, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental  contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life, so that to  have one we must forsake the other.  
1970_96	1970_96	With the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we can  do nothing. In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for ours and  generations to come.  
1970_97	1970_97	Between now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born in  the United States. Where they grow up and how will, more than any one  thing, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead.  
1970_99	1970_99	For the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.  The result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying out  of people and of promise a third of our counties lost population in the  sixties.  
1970_103	1970_103	In particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist in  the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones.  
1970_104	1970_104	At the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life in  America to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to the  city. What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance. It needs  to be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an overall  growth policy for America. We must create a new rural environment which  will not only stem the migration to urban centers, but reverse it. If we  seize our growth as a challenge, we can make the 1970's an historic period  when by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to  become.  
1970_106	1970_106	In the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America's  history, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, of  the summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the people,  the building of a nation.  
1970_107	1970_107	Those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.  
1970_108	1970_108	They remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which at  one critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to  the future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it.  
1970_115	1970_115	In times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve  such goals.  
1970_119	1970_119	Listen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not "for ourselves  alone, but for the whole human race."  
1970_121	1970_121	Today, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let it  not be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us  the hope of the world at the time of our birth.  
1970_123	1970_123	It is no longer enough to live and let live. Now we must live and help  live.  
1970_124	1970_124	We need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathe  freely and breathe in freedom.  
1970_125	1970_125	Our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same  thing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.  
1971_3	1971_3	Thank you.  
1971_7	1971_7	Mr. Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest  Congress in America's history.  
1971_10	1971_10	How shall we meet this challenge? How can we truly open the doors, and set  free the full genius of our people?  
1971_15	1971_15	The first of these great goals is already before the Congress.  
1971_18	1971_18	The most important is welfare reform.  
1971_21	1971_21	So let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in  America and without those demeaning, soul_stifling affronts to human  dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today. But let us also  establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement.  
1971_22	1971_22	Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves. This shall be  our goal.  
1971_24	1971_24	The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since  1957 full prosperity in peacetime.  
1971_26	1971_26	But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price  stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime  economy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increased  unemployment.  
1971_27	1971_27	We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in  this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any  peacetime year of the sixties.  
1971_33	1971_33	This is a great goal, and one that we can achieve together.  
1971_38	1971_38	As a fourth great goal, I will offer a far_reaching set of proposals for  improving America's health care and making it available more fairly to more  people.  
1971_43	1971_43	 New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the  causes of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to  keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick.  
1971_48	1971_48	And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity with  diversity and so clear was their vision that it survives today as the  oldest written constitution still in force in the world.  
1971_51	1971_51	The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resources  from the States and communities to Washington, and start power and  resources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities and,  more important, to the people all across America.  
1971_53	1971_53	To achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a  plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept.  
1971_54	1971_54	All across America today, States and cities are confronted with a financial  crisis. Some have already been cutting back on essential services _for  example, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trash  collections. Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one  hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other.  
1971_58	1971_58	I propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewing  State and local government. Five billion dollars of this will be in new and  unrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit. The  other $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new funds  and converting one_third of the money going to the present narrow_purpose  aid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes for  urban development, rural development, education, transportation, job  training, and law enforcement but with the States and localities making  their own decisions on how it should be spent within each category.  
1971_66	1971_66	Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well.  
1971_69	1971_69	The fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it grows  muscle_bound and the States and localities so weak they approach  impotence.  
1971_76	1971_76	The further away government is from people, the stronger government becomes  and the weaker people become. And a nation with a strong government and a  weak people is an empty shell.  
1971_79	1971_79	People came to America because they wanted to determine their own future  rather than to live in a country where others determined their future for  them.  
1971_83	1971_83	Based on a long and intensive study with the aid of the best advice  obtainable, I have concluded that a sweeping reorganization of the  executive branch is needed if the Government is to keep up with the times  and with the needs of the people.  
1971_89	1971_89	 Third, a department concerned with our physical environment, with the  preservation and balanced use of those great natural resources on which our  Nation depends.  
1971_91	1971_91	Under this plan, rather than dividing up our departments by narrow  subjects, we would organize them around the great purposes of government.  Rather than scattering responsibility by adding new levels of bureaucracy,  we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for getting problems  solved.  
1971_92	1971_92	With these four departments, when we have a problem we will know where to  go and the department will have the authority and the resources to do  something about it.  
1971_93	1971_93	Over the years we have added departments and created agencies at the  Federal level, each to serve a new constituency, to handle a particular  task and these have grown and multiplied in what has become a hopeless  confusion of form and function.  
1971_99	1971_99	And by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government at  the national level, we in Washington will at last be able to provide  government that is truly for the people.  
1971_108	1971_108	As I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land of  the open door as a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a place  of refuge, of hope.  
1971_109	1971_109	When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half  centuries ago, they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity and  they left wide the door of welcome for others to follow.  
1971_112	1971_112	For the black American, the Indian, the Mexican_American, and for those  others in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last has  begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal  opportunity, and of human dignity.  
1971_113	1971_113	For all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can open  the door to a new era of opportunity. We can open the door to full and  effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives. We can  open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels, between  those governments and the people themselves. And by so doing, we can open  wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in America  now and in the years to come.  
1971_116	1971_116	This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, with  full employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus of  war.  
1972_2	1972_2	Twenty_five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman along with  Speaker Albert and listened for the first time to the President address  the State of the Union.  
1972_8	1972_8	I shall not do that.  
1972_10	1972_10	I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of  passage. I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity  of this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to finance,  and which I believe should be above partisanship programs which deal with  urgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must be the subject of  bipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in  1972.  
1972_14	1972_14	The Nation has made significant progress in these first years of the  seventies:  
1972_18	1972_18	The rate of increase in crime has been slowed and here in the District of  Columbia, the one city where the Federal Government has direct  jurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from  the year before.  
1972_20	1972_20	As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go on  to build a generation of peace.  
1972_21	1972_21	To achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to maintain  our defense.  
1972_22	1972_22	In the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms. For the first time  in 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on human  resources.  
1972_24	1972_24	And that is why, because of rising research and development costs, because  of increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need to proceed  with new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide  for an increase in defense spending.  
1972_37	1972_37	 But we will use our influence to prevent war.  
1972_39	1972_39	 Once it is over, we will do our share in helping to bind up the wounds of  those who have participated in it.  
1972_48	1972_48	It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime  years of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men released from  the Armed Forces and defense_related industries were still in their wartime  jobs, unemployment would be far lower.  
1972_51	1972_51	The historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with the  major European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by providing  new markets for American products, new jobs for American workers.  
1972_52	1972_52	Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being  inflationary a job_producing budget that will help take up the gap as the  economy expands to full employment.  
1972_53	1972_53	Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize  rural America, by giving to America's farmers their fair share of America's  increasing productivity.  
1972_54	1972_54	We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set  of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America's great  capacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward improving the  quality of life for every American.  
1972_55	1972_55	In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology is  capable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberately  toward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing the  wonders of science to the service of man.  
1972_56	1972_56	I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new program  of Federal partnership in technological research and development with  Federal incentives to increase private research, federally supported  research on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that  will range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of  emergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually.  
1972_59	1972_59	Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American  goods to compete fairly in the world's markets but they still must  compete. The new technology program will put to use the skills of many  highly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted. It will  also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will thus  help to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for America's  workers in producing for the world's markets.  
1972_61	1972_61	I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have  presented to the Congress today.  
1972_63	1972_63	The west coast dock strike is a case in point. This Nation cannot and will  not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie_up in the future.  
1972_64	1972_64	The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our  structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.  
1972_65	1972_65	They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare  system substitution of a new system that provides work requirements and  work incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for those  who cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor.  
1972_66	1972_66	They include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with the  States and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment also  of faith in the American people.  
1972_68	1972_68	One year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session of  this Congress six great goals. One of these was welfare reform. That  proposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.  
1972_69	1972_69	My proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care,  and the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year.  Many of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here  that long or longer.  
1972_70	1972_70	Now, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures. Now  let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by the  Congress, for the Nation and for the people of America.  
1972_71	1972_71	Now, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previously  covered, but which must be placed on the national agenda.  
1972_72	1972_72	We long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the main  source of financing for public primary and secondary education.  
1972_74	1972_74	The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court  decisions, which have held that the conventional method of financing  schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and  unconstitutional.  
1972_80	1972_80	As we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change are  not only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world, and  particularly of our life in America.  
1972_81	1972_81	Surveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen rider  caught in the stirrups or we can sit high in the saddle, the masters of  change, directing it on a course we choose.  
1972_82	1972_82	The secret of mastering change in today's world is to reach back to old and  proven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to  the new realities of a new age.  
1972_86	1972_86	We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the  protection of individual rights and liberties.  
1972_91	1972_91	We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their  own lives, in their own communities and we believe in their right to make  those decisions.  
1972_95	1972_95	As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learn  once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another, we  are regaining that capacity.  
1972_99	1972_99	The world's hopes poured into America, along with its people. And those  hopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of the  world, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world.  
1972_101	1972_101	Those who say this do not know America.  
1972_109	1972_109	Together, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of the  Nation in our hands.  
1972_110	1972_110	Because this year is an election year, it will be a time of great  pressure.  
1972_113	1972_113	If we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all not only  for doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising above  partisan interest to serve the national interest.  
1972_114	1972_114	And if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser.  
1973_1	1973_1	To the Congress of the United States:  
1973_2	1973_2	The traditional form of the President's annual report giving "to the  Congress Information of the State of the Union" is a single message or  address. As the affairs and concerns of our Union have multiplied over the  years, however, so too have the subjects that require discussion in State  of the Union Messages.  
1973_4	1973_4	I have therefore decided to present my 1973 State of the Union report in  the form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd  Congress. The purpose of this first message in the series is to give a  concise overview of where we stand as a people today, and to outline some  of the general goals that I believe we should pursue over the next year and  beyond. In coming weeks, I will send to the Congress further State of the  Union reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs,  natural resources, human resources, community development and foreign and  defense policy.  
1973_5	1973_5	The new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach to  Government: an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s, not  those of the 1930s or of the 1960s. The role of the Federal Government as  we approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate any  facet of American life, but rather to aid and encourage people, communities  and institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challenges  facing them as possible, and to help see to it that every American has a  full and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential.  
1973_6	1973_6	If we were to continue to expand the Federal Government at the rate of the  past several decades, it soon would consume us entirely. The time has come  when we must make clear choices choices between old programs that set  worthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide a  better way to realize those goals; and choices, too, between competing  programs all of which may be desirable in themselves but only some of  which we can afford with the finite resources at our command.  
1973_8	1973_8	Finally, it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of  responsibility at the State and local level, and among individual  Americans.  
1973_11	1973_11	We enter 1973 economically strong, militarily secure and, most important of  all, at peace after a long and trying war.  
1973_12	1973_12	America continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of  its people than any other nation in the world. We have passed through one  of the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to  despair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people.  
1973_13	1973_13	Looking back, there is a lesson in all this for all of us. The lesson is  one that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years.  But we did learn it. That lesson is that even potentially destructive  forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel  them, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate  of mutual respect and goodwill.  
1973_14	1973_14	By working together and harnessing the forces of nature, Americans have  unlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe.  
1973_22	1973_22	But we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without  the will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice.  
1973_28	1973_28	The answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes and  more spending. It is less waste, more results and greater freedom for the  individual American to earn a rightful place in his own community and for  States and localities to address their own needs in their own ways, in the  light of their own priorities.  
1973_32	1973_32	In the field of economic affairs, our objectives will be to hold down  taxes, to continue controlling inflation, to promote economic growth, to  increase productivity, to encourage foreign trade, to keep farm income  high, to bolster small business, and to promote better labor_management  relations.  
1973_35	1973_35	We must do a better job in community development in creating more livable  communities, in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access to  opportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which now  plague so many of our towns and cities. I shall have proposals to help us  achieve this.  
1973_36	1973_36	I shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies, and with our new  approaches to the role and structure of Government itself.  
1973_39	1973_39	Working together the Congress, the President and the people I am  confident that we can translate these proposals into an action program that  can reform and revitalize American Government and, even more important,  build a better life for all Americans.  
1973_41	1973_41	February 2, 1973.  
1974_1	1974_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my colleagues in the Congress, our  distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:  
1974_9	1974_9	Five years ago, our college campuses were a battleground.  
1974_11	1974_11	Five years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening human  and social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program to deal  with it.  
1974_12	1974_12	Five years ago as young Americans had done for a generation before  that America's youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft.  
1974_13	1974_13	Five years ago, there was no national program to preserve our environment.  Day by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was getting more foul.  
1974_18	1974_18	In our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a policy  of confrontation to one of negotiation. For the first time since World War  II, the world's two strongest powers are working together toward peace in  the world. With the People's Republic of China after a generation of  hostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful exchange and  expanding trade.  
1974_21	1974_21	Overall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today. More  than 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone. That is  the biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years. People are earning  more. What they earn buys more, more than ever before in history. In the  past 5 years, the average American's real spendable income that is, what  you really can buy with your income, even after allowing for taxes and  inflation has increased by 16 percent.  
1974_22	1974_22	Despite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hear  once again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling us  now that because of the need to fight inflation, because of the energy  shortage, America may be headed for a recession.  
1974_24	1974_24	We are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation. There have been,  and there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight. But if this  Congress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of Government, we  shall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the American  people.  
1974_29	1974_29	We will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicine  of recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth  at a sustainable level.  
1974_33	1974_33	We will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it when  it is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for those who  need it the most.  
1974_35	1974_35	And we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that  bleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, and demeans those it is  intended to assist.  
1974_37	1974_37	In all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place, in  our history this is the first in which the one priority, the first  priority, is energy. Let me begin by reporting a new development which I  know will be welcome news to every American. As you know, we have committed  ourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peace  in the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338. The first step in the process is the disengagement  of Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking place.  
1974_40	1974_40	Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the American  people in our energy conservation program has already gone a long way  towards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated. Let us do  everything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States of  America.  
1974_42	1974_42	The new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary. Therefore,  I urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be made the  first priority of this session of the Congress. These measures will require  the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the  necessary information on their supplies. They will prevent the injustice of  windfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of  Americans. And they will give us the organization, the incentives, the  authorities needed to deal with the short_term emergency and to move toward  meeting our long_term needs.  
1974_43	1974_43	Just as 1970 was the year in which we began a full_scale effort to protect  the environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full_scale  effort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this decade but through  the 21st century.  
1974_44	1974_44	As we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversary  of this Nation's independence, let us press vigorously on toward the goal I  announced last November for Project Independence. Let this be our national  goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will  not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our  jobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving.  
1974_49	1974_49	Many of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years ago,  I commented that "Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at  all levels," and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalize  State and local governments, to make them more responsive to the people  they serve. I can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing  passed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made progress toward  that goal. After 40 years of moving power from the States and the  communities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving power back from  Washington to the States and communities and, most important, to the people  of America.  
1974_56	1974_56	I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the  Administration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress in  establishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs of  society, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle  of American liberty.  
1974_57	1974_57	Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago  that I termed the Nation's welfare system "a monstrous, consuming  outrage an outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and  particularly against the children that it is supposed to help."  
1974_59	1974_59	In these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the Congress to join me  in mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfare  system with one that works, one that is fair to those who need help or  cannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the taxpayer.  And let us have as our goal that there will be no Government program which  makes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.  
1974_70	1974_70	All of these are steps toward a future in which the world's peace and  prosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure.  
1974_73	1974_73	As we create more jobs, as we build a better health care system, as we  improve our education, as we develop new sources of energy, as we provide  more abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen the system  of private enterprise that produces our prosperity as we do all of this  and even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together as  a nation.  
1974_74	1974_74	Even more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government in  America is all about.  
1974_79	1974_79	It was 27 years ago that John F. Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, as  freshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union address  delivered by Harry Truman. I know from my talks with him, as members of the  Labor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then even  dreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this place  that I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me. It may well  be that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one of you out  there, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27 years from now,  in the year 2001.  
1974_81	1974_81	Mr. Speaker, and Mr. President, and my distinguished colleagues and our  guests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that  has been of great concern to all Americans over the past year. I refer, of  course, to the investigations of the so_called Watergate affair. As you  know, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of  material. I believe that I have provided all the material that he needs to  conclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to  clear the innocent.  
1974_82	1974_82	I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other  investigations of this matter to an end. One year of Watergate is enough.  
1974_86	1974_86	Another point I should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of the  House and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office that I  hold. And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was elected to  that office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of doing a job and  doing it as well as I possibly can. And I want you to know that I have no  intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people  elected me to do for the people of the United States.  
1975_5	1975_5	Today, that freshman Member from Michigan stands where Mr. Truman  stood, and I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good:  
1975_7	1975_7	Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more.  
1975_8	1975_8	Prices are too high, and sales are too slow.  
1975_12	1975_12	We depend on others for essential energy.  
1975_14	1975_14	Yet, what President Truman said on January 5, 1949, is even more true in  1975. We are better able to meet our people's needs. All Americans do have  a fairer chance to pursue happiness. Not only are we still the foremost  nation in the pursuit of peace but today's prospects of attaining it are  infinitely brighter.  
1975_15	1975_15	There were 59 million Americans employed at the start of 1949; now there  are more than 85 million Americans who have jobs. In comparable dollars,  the average income of the American family has doubled during the past 26  years.  
1975_20	1975_20	To bolster business and industry and to create new jobs, I propose a 1_year  tax reduction of $16 billion. Three_quarters would go to individuals and  one_quarter to promote business investment.  
1975_35	1975_35	I submitted to the last Congress a list of budget deferrals and  rescissions. There will be more cuts recommended in the budget that I will  submit. Even so, the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still much,  much too high. Not only is it too high for this year but the decisions we  make now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on expenditure  levels in future years. I think this is a very fundamental issue that we,  the Congress and I, must jointly solve.  
1975_37	1975_37	During the 1960's, this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which  we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a  disruption of supply. This surplus capacity enabled us to influence both  supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world. Our excess capacity  neutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel, and thus the  rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable  prices.  
1975_47	1975_47	I urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial  production at the Elk Hills, California, Naval Petroleum Reserve. In order  that we make greater use of domestic coal resources, I am submitting  amendments to the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act which  will greatly increase the number of powerplants that can be promptly  converted to coal.  
1975_48	1975_48	Obviously, voluntary conservation continues to be essential, but tougher  programs are needed and needed now. Therefore, I am using Presidential  powers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum products.  The crude oil fee level will be increased $1 per barrel on February 1, by  $2 per barrel on March 1, and by $3 per barrel on April 1. I will take  actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region. The foregoing  are interim administrative actions. They will be rescinded when the broader  but necessary legislation is enacted.  
1975_67	1975_67	Accordingly, I propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by  $16.5 billion. This will be done by raising the low_income allowance and  reducing tax rates. This continuing tax cut will primarily benefit lower_  and middle_income taxpayers.  
1975_71	1975_71	To offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic activity,  the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42 percent.  
1975_76	1975_76	We are a great Nation spiritually, politically, militarily,  diplomatically, and economically. America's commitment to international  security has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areas in  the Middle East, in Europe, and in Asia. Our turning away would unleash new  instabilities, new dangers around the globe, which, in turn, would threaten  our own security.  
1975_79	1975_79	Quite frankly, at stake is the future of industrialized democracies, which  have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30  years.  
1975_80	1975_80	The developing nations are also at a turning point. The poorest nations see  their hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies  shattered by the economic crisis. The long_term economic future for the  producers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions.  
1975_81	1975_81	Our relations with the Communist countries are a basic factor of the world  environment. We must seek to build a long_term basis for coexistence. We  will stand by our principles. We will stand by our interests. We will act  firmly when challenged. The kind of a world we want depends on a broad  policy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation.  
1975_84	1975_84	Military strength alone is not sufficient. Effective diplomacy is also  essential in preventing conflict, in building world understanding. The  Vladivostok negotiations with the Soviet Union represent a major step in  moderating strategic arms competition. My recent discussions with the  leaders of the Atlantic community, Japan, and South Korea have contributed  to meeting the common challenge.  
1975_85	1975_85	But we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the  President and the Congress. By the Constitution and tradition, the  execution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the President.  
1975_87	1975_87	But if our foreign policy is to be successful, we cannot rigidly restrict  in legislation the ability of the President to act. The conduct of  negotiations is ill_suited to such limitations. Legislative restrictions,  intended for the best motives and purposes, can have the opposite result,  as we have seen most recently in our trade relations with the Soviet  Union.  
1976_1	1976_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and  distinguished guests:  
1976_3	1976_3	In man's long, upward march from savagery and slavery throughout the  nearly 2,000 years of the Christian calendar, the nearly 6,000 years of  Jewish reckoning there have been many deep, terrifying valleys, but also  many bright and towering peaks.  
1976_5	1976_5	We have not remade paradise on Earth. We know perfection will not be found  here. But think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years.  
1976_6	1976_6	We came from many roots, and we have many branches. Yet all Americans  across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of  1776, those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge  among our shores, say in unison:  
1976_10	1976_10	We thought we could transform the country through massive national  programs, but often the programs did not work. Too often they only made  things worse. In our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly, we trampled on  sound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals. We  unbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of  Federal expenditures and borrowing. And we were not totally honest with  ourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for  them. Finally, we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems  while our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms.  
1976_13	1976_13	We must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual  and the government a balance that favors greater individual freedom and  self_reliance.  
1976_22	1976_22	And so, 1975 was a year of hard decisions, difficult compromises, and a new  realism that taught us something important about America. It brought back a  needed measure of common sense, steadfastness, and self_discipline.  
1976_25	1976_25	It is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary  American concept of 1776, which holds that in a free society the making of  public policy and successful problem_solving involves much more than  government. It involves a full partnership among all branches and all  levels of government, private institutions, and individual citizens.  
1976_26	1976_26	Common sense tells me to stick to that steady course.  
1976_28	1976_28	The worst recession since World War II turned around in April. The best  cost_of_living news of the past year is that double_digit inflation of 12  percent or higher was cut almost in half. The worst unemployment remains  far too high.  
1976_32	1976_32	My first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation.  
1976_35	1976_35	In the past decade, the Federal budget has been growing at an average rate  of over 10 percent a year. The budget I am submitting Wednesday cuts this  rate of growth in half. I have kept my promise to submit a budget for the  next fiscal year of $395 billion. In fact, it is $394.2 billion.  
1976_36	1976_36	By holding down the growth of Federal spending, we can afford additional  tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power  over their own lives.  
1976_39	1976_39	My recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of Federal spending  and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward. For every  dollar saved in cutting the growth in the Federal budget, we can have an  added dollar of Federal tax reduction.  
1976_40	1976_40	We can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the  wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of Federal spending.  
1976_42	1976_42	Five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in  industry. Common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and  to find them faster. I mean real, rewarding, permanent jobs.  
1976_44	1976_44	Within the strict budget total that I will recommend for the coming year, I  will ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 families. These  programs will expand housing opportunities, spur construction, and help to  house moderate_ and low_income families.  
1976_45	1976_45	We had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975. But with lower  interest rates and available mortgage money, we can have a healthy recovery  in 1976.  
1976_46	1976_46	A necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty  tyranny of massive government regulation. We are wasting literally millions  of working hours costing billions of taxpayers' and consumers' dollars  because of bureaucratic redtape. The American farmer, who now feeds 215  million Americans, but also millions worldwide, has shown how much more he  can produce without the shackles of government control.  
1976_47	1976_47	Now, we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy: the airlines,  trucking, railroads, and financial institutions. I have submitted concrete  plans in each of these areas, not to help this or that industry, but to  foster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer.  
1976_48	1976_48	This administration, in addition, will strictly enforce the Federal  antitrust laws for the very same purposes.  
1976_53	1976_53	Also, I ask, for the sake of future generations, that we preserve the  family farm and family_owned small business. Both strengthen America and  give stability to our economy. I will propose estate tax changes so that  family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to  generation without having to be sold to pay taxes.  
1976_55	1976_55	The Federal Government must and will respond to clear_cut national  needs for this and future generations.  
1976_56	1976_56	Hospital and medical services in America are among the best in the world,  but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a  family's lifetime savings. Increasing health costs are of deep concern to  all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living. The burden of  catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society. We must  eliminate this fear from every family.  
1976_57	1976_57	I propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by Medicare.  To finance this added protection, fees for short_term care will go up  somewhat, but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than $500  a year for covered hospital or nursing home care, nor more than $250 for 1  year's doctor bills.  
1976_58	1976_58	We cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance  providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans. The experience of  other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of  such plans. But I do envision the day when we may use the private health  insurance system to offer more middle_income families high quality health  services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their  catastrophic illnesses.  
1976_64	1976_64	I must, therefore, recommend a three_tenths of 1 percent increase in both  employer and employee social security taxes effective January 1, 1977. This  will cost each covered employee less than 1 extra dollar a week and will  ensure the integrity of the trust fund.  
1976_66	1976_66	In my fiscal year 1977 budget, I am also requesting funds to continue  proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of  other Americans.  
1976_70	1976_70	Nevertheless, there are still plenty of improvements that we can make. I  will ask Congress for Presidential authority to tighten up the rules for  eligibility and benefits.  
1976_71	1976_71	Last year I twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal_riddled food  stamp program. This year I say again: Let's give food stamps to those most  in need. Let's not give any to those who don't need them.  
1976_72	1976_72	Protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the  responsibility of all public officials, but is primarily the job of local  and State law enforcement authorities.  
1976_78	1976_78	My budget recommends 500 additional Federal agents in the 11 largest  metropolitan high_crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from  selling and using handguns.  
1976_88	1976_88	In a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic  missiles, in a world economy that is global and interdependent, our  relations with other nations become more, not less, important to the lives  of Americans.  
1976_92	1976_92	Our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the Atlantic  community and Japan have never been more solid.  
1976_94	1976_94	We have an improving relationship with China, the world's most populous  nation.  
1976_95	1976_95	The key elements for peace among the nations of the Middle East now exist.  Our traditional friendships in Latin America, Africa, and Asia continue.  
1976_97	1976_97	We have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary  system.  
1976_105	1976_105	Some hasty actions of the Congress during the past year most recently in  respect to Angola were, in my view, very shortsighted. Unfortunately, they  are still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries.  
1976_108	1976_108	We are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our  military forces. But the budget I will submit represents the necessity of  American strength for the real world in which we live.  
1976_110	1976_110	The crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of  American involvement in direct armed conflict. Our adversaries are  encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor  events and to influence events short of military action is undermined.  Without effective intelligence capability, the United States stands  blindfolded and hobbled.  
1976_112	1976_112	Tonight I have spoken about our problems at home and abroad. I have  recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century. I  have no doubt that our Union will endure, better, stronger, and with more  individual freedom. We can see forward only dimly 1 year, 5 years, a  generation perhaps. Like our forefathers, we know that if we meet the  challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction,  if we remain true to our Constitution and to our ideals, then we can know  that the future will be better than the past.  
1976_118	1976_118	President Eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart  of America. His simple words echoed President Lincoln's eloquent testament  that "right makes might." And Lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of  George Washington kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge.  
1977_3	1977_3	This report will be my last maybe [laughter] but for the Union it is  only the first of such reports in our third century of independence, the  close of which none of us will ever see. We can be confident, however, that  100 years from now a freely elected President will come before a freely  elected Congress chosen to renew our great Republic's pledge to the  Government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  
1977_4	1977_4	For my part I pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all  Americans, our children and their children's children, a greater measure of  individual equality, opportunity, and justice, a greater abundance of  spiritual and material blessings, and a higher quality of life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.  
1977_5	1977_5	The state of the Union is a measurement of the many elements of which it is  composed a political union of diverse States, an economic union of varying  interests, an intellectual union of common convictions, and a moral union  of immutable ideals.  
1977_6	1977_6	Taken in sum, I can report that the state of the Union is good. There is  room for improvement, as always, but today we have a more perfect Union  than when my stewardship began.  
1977_7	1977_7	As a people we discovered that our Bicentennial was much more than a  celebration of the past; it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it  means to be Americans, a confirmation before all the world of the vitality  and durability of our free institutions. I am proud to have been privileged  to preside over the affairs of our Federal Government during these eventful  years when we proved, as I said in my first words upon assuming office,  that "our Constitution works; our great Republic is a Government of laws  and not of men. Here the people rule."  
1977_8	1977_8	The people have spoken; they have chosen a new President and a new Congress  to work their will. I congratulate you particularly the new Members as  sincerely as I did President_elect Carter. In a few days it will be his  duty to outline for you his priorities and legislative recommendations.  Tonight I will not infringe on that responsibility, but rather wish him the  very best in all that is good for our country.  
1977_9	1977_9	During the period of my own service in this Capitol and in the White House,  I can recall many orderly transitions of governmental responsibility of  problems as well as of position, of burdens as well as of power. The genius  of the American system is that we do this so naturally and so normally.  There are no soldiers marching in the street except in the Inaugural  Parade; no public demonstrations except for some of the dancers at the  Inaugural Ball; the opposition party doesn't go underground, but goes on  functioning vigorously in the Congress and in the country; and our vigilant  press goes right on probing and publishing our faults and our follies,  confirming the wisdom of the framers of the first amendment.  
1977_14	1977_14	By January 1976 we were headed in a new direction, which I hold to be the  right direction for a free society. It was guided by the belief that  successful problem_solving requires more than Federal action alone, that it  involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government  and public policies which nurture and promote the creative energies of  private enterprises, institutions, and individual citizens.  
1977_27	1977_27	In Latin America, our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense of  common enterprise.  
1977_28	1977_28	In Africa the quest for peace, racial justice, and economic progress is at  a crucial point. The United States, in close cooperation with the United  Kingdom, is actively engaged in this historic process. Will change come  about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention? Or will it come about  by negotiated and fair solutions, ensuring majority rule, minority rights,  and economic advance? America is committed to the side of peace and justice  and to the principle that Africa should shape its own future, free of  outside intervention.  
1977_29	1977_29	American leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to  stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive  treaty governing the use of oceans.  
1977_30	1977_30	I am gratified by these accomplishments. They constitute a record of broad  success for America and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind. This  administration leaves to its successor a world in better condition than we  found. We leave, as well, a solid foundation for progress on a range of  issues that are vital to the well_being of America.  
1977_36	1977_36	Earlier this month I proposed a permanent income tax reduction of $10  billion below current levels, including raising the personal exemption from  $750 to $1,000. I also recommended a series of measures to stimulate  investment, such as accelerated depreciation for new plants and equipment  in areas of high unemployment, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from  48 to 46 percent, and eliminating the present double taxation of dividends.  I strongly urge the Congress to pass these measures to help create the  productive, permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for  our future.  
1977_43	1977_43	Two years ago I proposed to the Congress the first comprehensive national  energy program a specific and coordinated set of measures that would end  our vulnerability to embargo, blockade, or arbitrary price increases and  would mobilize U.S. technology and resources to supply a significant share  of the free world's energy after 1985. Of the major energy proposals I  submitted 2 years ago, only half, belatedly, became law. In 1973 we were  dependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent of our needs. Today, we  are 40_percent dependent, and we'll pay out $34 billion for foreign oil  this year. Such vulnerability at present or in the future is intolerable  and must be ended.  
1977_45	1977_45	We have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which  confronts us. I have signed into law five major energy bills which contain  significant measures for conservation, resource development, stockpiling,  and standby authorities. We have moved forward to develop the naval  petroleum reserves; to build a 500_million barrel strategic petroleum  stockpile; to phase out unnecessary Government allocation and price  controls; to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consuming  nations; to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in  automobiles, buildings, and industry; and to expand research on new  technology and renewable resources such as wind power, geothermal and solar  energy. All these actions, significant as they are for the long term, are  only the beginning.  
1977_46	1977_46	I recently submitted to the Congress my proposals to reorganize the Federal  energy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are serious about  reducing our dependence upon foreign energy. These include programs to  reverse our declining production of natural gas and increase incentives for  domestic crude oil production. I proposed to minimize environmental  uncertainties affecting coal development, expand nuclear power generation,  and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial  assistance for vital energy programs where private capital is not  available.  
1977_47	1977_47	We must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when  our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in  the next decade. I urgently ask Congress and the new administration to move  quickly on these issues. This Nation has the resources and the capability  to achieve our energy goals if its Government has the will to proceed, and  I think we do.  
1977_48	1977_48	I have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful  organizational reforms which I contemplated for the Federal Government,  although a start has been made. For example, the Federal judicial system  has long served as a model for other courts. But today it is threatened by  a shortage of qualified Federal judges and an explosion of litigation  claiming Federal jurisdiction. I commend to the new administration and the  Congress the recent report and recommendations of the Department of  Justice, undertaken at my request, on "the needs of the Federal Courts." I  especially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial  appointment process.  
1977_50	1977_50	We have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government and  its intrusion into individual lives, but believe me, there is much more to  be done and you and I know it. It can only be done by tough and  temporarily painful surgery by a Congress as prepared as the President to  face up to this very real political problem. Again, I wish my successor,  working with a substantial majority of his own party, the best of success  in reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the Federal  Government.  
1977_52	1977_52	America's first goal is and always will be peace with honor. America must  remain first in keeping peace in the world. We can remain first in peace  only if we are never second in defense.  
1977_54	1977_54	I am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2 1/2 years, we  have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in  real resources this country was devoting to national defense. This was an  immediate problem I faced in 1974. The evidence was unmistakable that the  Soviet Union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to  building its military strength. During this same period the United States  real defense spending declined. In my three budgets we not only arrested  that dangerous decline, but we have established the positive trend which is  essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the  world.  
1977_61	1977_61	We cannot rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or to  deter all types of aggression. We must have superior naval and marine  forces to maintain freedom of the seas, strong multipurpose tactical air  forces, and mobile, modern ground forces. Accordingly, I have directed a  long_term effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with  regional crises.  
1977_64	1977_64	As I look to the future and I assure you I intend to go on doing that for  a good many years I can say with confidence that the state of the Union is  good, but we must go on making it better and better.  
1977_66	1977_66	Like President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I  look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude.  To me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the greatest  honor and privilege in this world.  
1977_68	1977_68	It is not easy to end these remarks. In this Chamber, along with some of  you, I have experienced many, many of the highlights of my life. It was  here that I stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues, as Speaker Sam  Rayburn administered the oath. I see some of you now Charlie Bennett, Dick  Bolling, Carl Perkins, Pete Rodino, Harley Staggers, Tom Steed, Sid Yates,  Clem Zablocki_and I remember those who have gone to their rest. It was here  we waged many, many a lively battle won some, lost some, but always  remaining friends. It was here, surrounded by such friends, that the  distinguished Chief Justice swore me in as Vice President on December 6,  1973. It was here I returned 8 months later as your President to ask not  for a honeymoon, but for a good marriage.  
1978_2	1978_2	I return tonight to fulfill one of those duties of the Constitution: to  give to the Congress, and to the Nation, information on the state of the  Union.  
1978_3	1978_3	Militarily, politically, economically, and in spirit, the state of our  Union is sound.  
1978_4	1978_4	We are a great country, a strong country, a vital and dynamic country, and  so we will remain.  
1978_6	1978_6	I want to speak to you tonight about where we are and where we must go,  about what we have done and what we must do. And I want to pledge to you my  best efforts and ask you to pledge yours.  
1978_9	1978_9	There are other times when there is no single overwhelming crisis, yet  profound national interests are at stake.  
1978_11	1978_11	That is what Harry Truman did in the years after the Second World War, when  we helped Europe and Japan rebuild themselves and secured an international  order that has protected freedom from aggression.  
1978_14	1978_14	There is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common  purpose. This sense of unity cannot be expressed in programs or in  legislation or in dollars. It's an achievement that belongs to every  individual American. This unity ties together, and it towers over all our  efforts here in Washington, and it serves as an inspiring beacon for all of  us who are elected to serve.  
1978_15	1978_15	This new atmosphere demands a new spirit, a partnership between those of us  who lead and those who elect. The foundations of this partnership are  truth, the courage to face hard decisions, concern for one another and the  common good over special interests, and a basic faith and trust in the  wisdom and strength and judgment of the American people.  
1978_18	1978_18	We must make a maximum effort, because if we do not aim for the best, we  are very likely to achieve little. I see no benefit to the country if we  delay, because the problems will only get worse.  
1978_19	1978_19	We need patience and good will, but we really need to realize that there is  a limit to the role and the function of government. Government cannot solve  our problems, it can't set our goals, it cannot define our vision.  Government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or  reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide energy.  And government cannot mandate goodness. Only a true partnership between  government and the people can ever hope to reach these goals.  
1978_20	1978_20	Those of us who govern can sometimes inspire, and we can identify needs and  marshal resources, but we simply cannot be the managers of everything and  everybody.  
1978_25	1978_25	Our main task at home this year, with energy a central element, is the  Nation's economy. We must continue the recovery and further cut  unemployment and inflation.  
1978_27	1978_27	The rate of inflation went down. There was a good growth in business  profits and investments, the source of more jobs for our workers, and a  higher standard of living for all our people. After taxes and inflation,  there was a healthy increase in workers' wages.  
1978_30	1978_30	We still have serious problems on which all of us must work together. Our  trade deficit is too large. Inflation is still too high, and too many  Americans still do not have a job.  
1978_42	1978_42	I'll be asking you for a substantial increase in funds for public jobs for  our young people, and I also am recommending that the Congress continue the  public service employment programs at more than twice the level of a year  ago. When welfare reform is completed, we will have more than a million  additional jobs so that those on welfare who are able to work can work.  
1978_45	1978_45	I am proposing an increase of less than 2 percent after adjusting for  inflation, the smallest increase in the Federal budget in 4 years.  
1978_47	1978_47	In time of high employment and a strong economy, deficit spending should  not be a feature of our budget. As the economy continues to gain strength  and as our unemployment rates continue to fall, revenues will grow. With  careful planning, efficient management, and proper restraint on spending,  we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget, and we will.  
1978_51	1978_51	Now, no one firm or a group of workers can halt this process. It's an  effort that we must all make together. I'm therefore asking government,  business, labor, and other groups to join in a voluntary program to  moderate inflation by holding wage and price increases in each sector of  the economy during 1978 below the average increases of the last 2 years.  
1978_52	1978_52	I do not believe in wage and price controls. A sincere commitment to  voluntary constraint provides a way, perhaps the only way, to fight  inflation without Government interference.  
1978_56	1978_56	Economic success at home is also the key to success in our international  economic policy. An effective energy program, strong investment and  productivity, and controlled inflation will provide [improve] our trade  balance and balance it, and it will help to protect the integrity of the  dollar overseas.  
1978_64	1978_64	We've already begun a series of reorganization plans which will be  completed over a period of 3 years. We have also proposed abolishing almost  500 Federal advisory and other commissions and boards. But I know that the  American people are still sick and tired of Federal paperwork and redtape.  Bit by bit we are chopping down the thicket of unnecessary Federal  regulations by which Government too often interferes in our personal lives  and our personal business. We've cut the public's Federal paperwork load by  more than 12 percent in less than a year. And we are not through cutting.  
1978_65	1978_65	We've made a good start on turning the gobbledygook of Federal regulations  into plain English that people can understand. But we know that we still  have a long way to go.  
1978_66	1978_66	We've brought together parts of 11 Government agencies to create a new  Department of Energy. And now it's time to take another major step by  creating a separate Department of Education.  
1978_73	1978_73	We stand for human rights because we believe that government has as a  purpose to promote the well_being of its citizens. This is true in our  domestic policy; it's also true in our foreign policy. The world must know  that in support of human rights, the United States will stand firm.  
1978_74	1978_74	We expect no quick or easy results, but there has been significant movement  toward greater freedom and humanity in several parts of the world.  
1978_79	1978_79	Security also comes through the strength of our alliances. We have  reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe, and this year we will  demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our  military capabilities there.  
1978_80	1978_80	Security can also be enhanced by agreements with potential adversaries  which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintaining our own  relative strategic capability.  
1978_85	1978_85	For 30 years, concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban the  testing of atomic explosives, both military weapons and peaceful nuclear  devices.  
1978_86	1978_86	We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an agreement  which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide  for adequate verification of compliance. We are now making, I believe, good  progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions.  
1978_87	1978_87	We are also working vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons  among the nations of the world which do not now have them and to reduce the  deadly global traffic in conventional arms sales. Our stand for peace is  suspect if we are also the principal arms merchant of the world. So, we've  decided to cut down our arms transfers abroad on a year_by_year basis and  to work with other major arms exporters to encourage their similar  constraint.  
1978_89	1978_89	In the Middle East, we are contributing our good offices to maintain the  momentum of the current negotiations and to keep open the lines of  communication among the Middle Eastern leaders. The whole world has a great  stake in the success of these efforts. This is a precious opportunity for a  historic settlement of a longstanding conflict, an opportunity which may  never come again in our lifetime.  
1978_92	1978_92	This requires strong economic performance by the industrialized democracies  like ourselves and progress in resolving the global energy crisis. Last  fall, with the help of others, we succeeded in our vigorous efforts to  maintain the stability of the price of oil. But as many foreign leaders  have emphasized to me personally and, I am sure, to you, the greatest  future contribution that America can make to the world economy would be an  effective energy conservation program here at home. We will not hesitate to  take the actions needed to protect the integrity of the American dollar.  
1978_93	1978_93	We are trying to develop a more just international system. And in this  spirit, we are supporting the struggle for human development in Africa, in  Asia, and in Latin America.  
1978_94	1978_94	Finally, the world is watching to see how we act on one of our most  important and controversial items of business, approval of the Panama Canal  treaties. The treaties now before the Senate are the result of the work of  four administrations, two Democratic, two Republican.  
1978_97	1978_97	I have to say that that's very welcome applause.  
1978_98	1978_98	There were two moments on my recent journey which, for me, confirmed the  final aims of our foreign policy and what it always must be.  
1978_101	1978_101	What I saw in those two places crystalized for me the purposes of our own  Nation's policy: to ensure economic justice, to advance human rights, to  resolve conflicts without violence, and to proclaim in our great democracy  our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human beings everywhere.  
1978_103	1978_103	It has been said that our best years are behind us. But I say again that  America's best is still ahead. We have emerged from bitter experiences  chastened but proud, confident once again, ready to face challenges once  again, and united once again.  
1978_105	1978_105	And today, the flag of the United States flew at half_mast from this  Capitol and from American installations and ships all over the world, in  mourning for Senator Hubert Humphrey.  
1978_106	1978_106	Because he exemplified so well the joy and the zest of living, his death  reminds us not so much of our own mortality, but of the possibilities  offered to us by life. He always looked to the future with a special  American kind of confidence, of hope and enthusiasm. And the best way that  we can honor him is by following his example.  
1978_108	1978_108	Reconciliation of private needs and interests into a higher purpose.  
1978_109	1978_109	Rebuilding the old dreams of justice and liberty, and country and  community.  
1978_110	1978_110	Rebirth of our faith in the common good.  
1978_111	1978_111	Each of us here tonight, and all who are listening in your homes, must  rededicate ourselves to serving the common good. We are a community, a  beloved community, all of us. Our individual fates are linked, our futures  intertwined. And if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit, together,  as the Bible says, we can move mountains.  
1978_112	1978_112	Thank you very much.  
1979_1	1979_1	Tonight I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American  Union how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous  world.  
1979_2	1979_2	Our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st  century. What kind of society, what kind of world are we building for them?  Will we ourselves be at peace? Will our children enjoy a better quality of  life? Will a strong and united America still be a force for freedom and  prosperity around the world?  
1979_6	1979_6	Our earliest national commitments, modified and reshaped by succeeding  generations, have served us well. But the problems that we face today are  different from those that confronted earlier generations of Americans. They  are more subtle, more complex, and more interrelated. At home, we are  recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot solve these  problems. And abroad, few of them can be solved by the United States alone.  But Americans as a united people, working with our allies and friends, have  never been afraid to face problems and to solve problems, either here or  abroad.  
1979_7	1979_7	The challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the  future for a sound economy, for a more effective government, for more  political trust, and for a stable peace so that the America our children  inherit will be even stronger and even better than it is today.  
1979_15	1979_15	Business and labor have been increasingly supportive. It's imperative that  we in government do our part. We must stop excessive government growth, and  we must control government spending habits.  
1979_24	1979_24	There will be no clearer test of the commitment of this Congress to the  anti_inflation fight than the legislation that I will submit again this  year to hold down inflation in hospital care.  
1979_27	1979_27	We must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our  economy. Through deregulation of the airline industry we've increased  profits, cut prices for all Americans, and begun for one of the few times  in the history of our Nation to actually dismantle a major Federal  bureaucracy. This year, we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory  processes for the railroad, bus, and the trucking industries.  
1979_29	1979_29	I call on Congress to take other anti_inflation action to expand our  exports to protect American jobs threatened by unfair trade, to conserve  energy, to increase production and to speed development of solar power, and  to reassess our Nation's technological superiority. American workers who  enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude, but  they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that I have  already made to the Congress.  
1979_30	1979_30	To be successful, we must change our attitudes as well as our policies. We  cannot afford to live beyond our means. We cannot afford to create programs  that we can neither manage nor finance, or to waste our natural resources,  and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud. Above all, we must meet the  challenges of inflation as a united people.  
1979_33	1979_33	With the support of the Congress, we've begun to reorganize and to get  control of the bureaucracy. We are reforming the civil service system, so  that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct or  remove those who do not.  
1979_34	1979_34	This year, we must extend major reorganization efforts to education, to  economic development, and to the management of our natural resources. We  need to enact a sunshine [sunset] law that when government programs have  outlived their value, they will automatically be terminated.  
1979_41	1979_41	But our national security in this complicated age requires more than just  military might. In less than a lifetime, world population has more than  doubled, colonial empires have disappeared, and a hundred new nations have  been born, and migration to the world's cities have all awakened new  yearnings for economic justice and human rights among people everywhere.  
1979_44	1979_44	Towering over this volatile, changing world, like a thundercloud on a  summer day, looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons.  
1979_45	1979_45	We will continue to help shape the forces of change, to anticipate emerging  problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales, and to use  our great strength parts of the world before they erupt and spread.  
1979_46	1979_46	We have no desire to be the world's policeman. But America does want to be  the world's peacemaker.  
1979_52	1979_52	In the Middle East, under the most difficult circumstances, we have sought  to help ancient enemies lay aside deep_seated differences that have  produced four bitter wars in our lifetime.  
1979_55	1979_55	The new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no  nation. Cooperation with the Soviet Union serves the cause of peace, for in  this nuclear age, world peace must include peace between the super  powers and it must mean the control of nuclear arms.  
1979_64	1979_64	I've outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and which  are continuing as we meet here tonight. But we in America need not fear  change. The values on which our Nation was founded: individual liberty,  self_determination, the potential for human fulfillment in freedom, all of  these endure. We find these democratic principles praised, even in books  smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on wallposters in lands which we  thought were closed to our influence. Our country has regained its special  place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human rights. And that is  a commitment that we must keep at home, as well as abroad.  
1979_67	1979_67	As long as I'm President, at home and around the world America's examples  and America's influence will be marshaled to advance the cause of human  rights.  
1979_73	1979_73	Thank you very much.  
1980_2	1980_2	The 1980's have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of  challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our  wisdom and our skills.  
1980_12	1980_12	Since the end of the Second World War, America has led other nations in  meeting the challenge of mounting Soviet power. This has not been a simple  or a static relationship. Between us there has been cooperation, there has  been competition, and at times there has been confrontation.  
1980_13	1980_13	In the 1940's we took the lead in creating the Atlantic Alliance in  response to the Soviet Union's suppression and then consolidation of its  East European empire and the resulting threat of the Warsaw Pact to Western  Europe.  
1980_15	1980_15	In the 1960's we met the Soviet challenges in Berlin, and we faced the  Cuban missile crisis. And we sought to engage the Soviet Union in the  important task of moving beyond the cold war and away from confrontation.  
1980_17	1980_17	In all these actions, we have maintained two commitments: to be ready to  meet any challenge by Soviet military power, and to develop ways to resolve  disputes and to keep the peace.  
1980_19	1980_19	We superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the  use of our great military force. The integrity and the independence of  weaker nations must not be threatened. They must know that in our presence  they are secure.  
1980_24	1980_24	The region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of  great strategic importance: It contains more than two_thirds of the world's  exportable oil. The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought  Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to  the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the world's oil  must flow. The Soviet Union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic  position, therefore, that poses a grave threat to the free movement of  Middle East oil.  
1980_25	1980_25	This situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute action,  not only for this year but for many years to come. It demands collective  efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian Gulf and in  Southwest Asia. It demands the participation of all those who rely on oil  from the Middle East and who are concerned with global peace and stability.  And it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the  area which might be threatened.  
1980_27	1980_27	Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to  gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on  the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault  will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.  
1980_28	1980_28	During the past 3 years, you have joined with me to improve our own  security and the prospects for peace, not only in the vital oil_producing  area of the Persian Gulf region but around the world. We've increased  annually our real commitment for defense, and we will sustain this increase  of effort throughout the Five Year Defense Program. It's imperative that  Congress approve this strong defense budget for 1981, encompassing a  5_percent real growth in authorizations, without any reduction.  
1980_30	1980_30	We are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the Middle East. The  peace treaty between Egypt and Israel is a notable achievement which  represents a strategic asset for America and which also enhances prospects  for regional and world peace. We are now engaged in further negotiations to  provide full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza, to resolve  the Palestinian issue in all its aspects, and to preserve the peace and  security of Israel. Let no one doubt our commitment to the security of  Israel. In a few days we will observe an historic event when Israel makes  another major withdrawal from the Sinai and when Ambassadors will be  exchanged between Israel and Egypt.  
1980_32	1980_32	We've increased and strengthened our naval presence in the Indian Ocean,  and we are now making arrangements for key naval and air facilities to be  used by our forces in the region of northeast Africa and the Persian Gulf.  
1980_33	1980_33	We've reconfirmed our 1959 agreement to help Pakistan preserve its  independence and its integrity. The United States will take action  consistent with our own laws to assist Pakistan in resisting any outside  aggression. And I'm asking the Congress specifically to reaffirm this  agreement. I'm also working, along with the leaders of other nations, to  provide additional military and economic aid for Pakistan. That request  will come to you in just a few days.  
1980_34	1980_34	Finally, we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to  share a cooperative security framework that respects differing values and  political beliefs, yet which enhances the independence, security, and  prosperity of all.  
1980_35	1980_35	All these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve  the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we represent and  those of our allies in Europe and the Pacific, and also in the parts of  the world which have such great strategic importance to us, stretching  especially through the Middle East and Southwest Asia. With your help, I  will pursue these efforts with vigor and with determination. You and I will  act as necessary to protect and to preserve our Nation's security.  
1980_39	1980_39	In repressive regimes, popular frustrations often have no outlet except  through violence. But when peoples and their governments can approach their  problems together through open, democratic methods, the basis for stability  and peace is far more solid and far more enduring. That is why our support  for human rights in other countries is in our own national interest as well  as part of our own national character.  
1980_47	1980_47	As individuals and as families, few of us can produce energy by ourselves.  But all of us can conserve energy every one of us, every day of our lives.  Tonight I call on you in fact, all the people of America to help our  Nation. Conserve energy. Eliminate waste. Make 1980 indeed a year of energy  conservation.  
1980_48	1980_48	Of course, we must take other actions to strengthen our Nation's economy.  
1980_54	1980_54	With these energy and economic policies, we will make America even stronger  at home in this decade just as our foreign and defense policies will make  us stronger and safer throughout the world. We will never abandon our  struggle for a just and a decent society here at home. That's the heart of  America and it's the source of our ability to inspire other people to  defend their own rights abroad.  
1980_55	1980_55	Our material resources, great as they are, are limited. Our problems are  too complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions. We cannot solve them  without effort and sacrifice. Walter Lippmann once reminded us, "You took  the good things for granted. Now you must earn them again. For every right  that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill. For every good  which you wish to preserve, you will have to sacrifice your comfort and  your ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer."  
1980_56	1980_56	Our challenges are formidable. But there's a new spirit of unity and  resolve in our country. We move into the 1980's with confidence and hope  and a bright vision of the America we want: an America strong and free, an  America at peace, an America with equal rights for all citizens and for  women, guaranteed in the United States Constitution an America with jobs  and good health and good education for every citizen, an America with a  clean and bountiful life in our cities and on our farms, an America that  helps to feed the world, an America secure in filling its own energy needs,  an America of justice, tolerance, and compassion. For this vision to come  true, we must sacrifice, but this national commitment will be an exciting  enterprise that will unify our people.  
1981_9	1981_9	 public trust in the integrity and openness of the government was low;  
1981_10	1981_10	 the Federal government was operating inefficiently in administering  essential programs and policies;  
1981_13	1981_13	 the strength of the NATO Alliance needed to be bolstered;  
1981_22	1981_22	 the regulatory process has been reformed through creation of the  Regulatory Council, implementation of Executive Order 12044 and its  requirement for cost_impact analyses, elimination of unnecessary  regulation, and passage of the Regulatory Flexibility Act;  
1981_23	1981_23	 procedures have been established to assure citizen participation in  government;  
1981_26	1981_26	 an urban policy was developed and implemented to reverse the decline  in our urban areas;  
1981_29	1981_29	 Federal assistance for education was expanded by more than 75 percent;  
1981_35	1981_35	 reversing previous trends, real defense spending has increased every year  since 1977;  
1981_41	1981_41	 we have continued this Nation's strong commitment to the pursuit of human  rights throughout the world, evenhandedly and objectively;  
1981_42	1981_42	 our commitment to a worldwide human rights policy has remained firm;  
1981_50	1981_50	Accordingly, I am asking the Congress to postpone until January 1, 1982,  the personal tax reductions I had earlier proposed to take effect on  January 1 of this year.  
1981_51	1981_51	However, my 1982 budget proposes significant tax changes to increase the  sources of financing for business investment. While emphasizing the need  for continued fiscal restraint, this budget takes the first major step in a  long_term tax reduction program designed to increase capital formation. The  failure of our Nation's capital stock to grow at a rate that keeps pace  with its labor force has clearly been one cause of our productivity  slowdown. Higher investment rates are also critically needed to meet our  Nation's energy needs, and to replace energy_inefficient plants and  equipment with new energy_saving physical plants. The level of investment  that is called for will not occur in the absence of policies to encourage  it.  
1981_52	1981_52	Therefore, my budget proposes a major liberalization of tax allowances for  depreciation, as well as simplified depreciation accounting, increasing the  allowable rates by about 40 percent. I am also proposing improvements in  the investment tax credit, making it refundable, to meet the investment  needs of firms with no current earnings.  
1981_54	1981_54	THE 1982 BUDGET  
1981_59	1981_59	We have also recognized the need to simplify the system of grants to State  and local governments. I have again proposed several grant consolidations  in the 1982 budget, including a new proposal that would consolidate several  highway programs.  
1981_61	1981_61	Our Nation's armed forces must always stand sufficiently strong to deter  aggression and to assure our security. An effective national energy plan is  essential to increase domestic production of oil and gas, to encourage  conservation of our scarce energy resources, to stimulate conversion to  more abundant fuels, and to reduce our trade deficit. The essential human  needs for our citizens must be given the highest priority. The Federal  Government must lead the way in investment in the Nation's technological  future. The Federal Government has an obligation to nurture and protect our  environment the common resource, birthright, and sustenance of the  American people.  
1981_63	1981_63	Fiscal restraint must be continued in the years ahead. Budgets must be  tight enough to convince those who set wages and prices that the Federal  Government is serious about fighting inflation but not so tight as to choke  off all growth.  
1981_64	1981_64	Careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed to  reduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and employment. These other  steps include measures to increase investment such as the tax proposals  included in my 1982 budget and measures to increase competition and  productivity in our economy. Voluntary incomes policies can also directly  influence wages and prices in the direction of moderation and thereby bring  inflation down faster and at lower cost to the economy. Through a tax_based  incomes policy (TIP) we could provide tax incentives for firms and workers  to moderate their wage and price increases. In the coming years, control of  Federal expenditures can make possible periodic tax reductions. The  Congress should therefore begin now to evaluate the potentialities of a TIP  program so that when the next round of tax reductions is appropriate a TIP  program will be seriously considered.  
1981_68	1981_68	Major initiatives launched by this Administration helped bring about these  accomplishments and have provided a solid foundation for employment and  training policy in the 1980's. In 1977, as part of the comprehensive  economic stimulus program:  
1981_70	1981_70	In 1978:  
1981_71	1981_71	The Humphrey_Hawkins Full Employment Act became law the $400 million  Private Sector Initiatives Program was begun a targeted jobs tax credit for  disadvantaged youth and others with special employment barriers was enacted  the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act was reauthorized for four  years.  
1981_74	1981_74	In 1980:  
1981_75	1981_75	The findings of the Vice President's Task Force revealed the major  education and employment deficits that exist for poor and minority  youngsters. As a result a $2 billion youth education and jobs initiative  was introduced to provide unemployed youth with the basic education and  work experience they need to compete in the labor market of the 1980's. As  part of the economic revitalization program several steps were proposed to  aid workers in high unemployment communities:  
1981_81	1981_81	TRADE  
1981_86	1981_86	The trade position of the United States has improved. But vigorous efforts  are needed in a number of areas to assure continued market access for U.S.  exports, particularly agricultural and high technology products, in which  the United States continues to have a strong competitive edge. Continued  efforts are also needed to remove many domestic disincentives, which now  hamper U.S. export growth. And we must ensure that countries do not  manipulate investment, or impose investment performance requirements which  distort trade and cost us jobs in this country.  
1981_90	1981_90	Because this sector of the economy is the very lifeblood of our National  economy, we have done much together to improve the competitive climate for  smaller firms. These concerted efforts have been an integral part of my  program to revitalize the economy.  
1981_96	1981_96	The Federal government's procurement from minority_owned firms has nearly  tripled since I took office. Federal deposits in minority_owned banks have  more than doubled and minority ownership of radio and television stations  has nearly doubled. The SBA administered 8(a) Pilot Program for procurement  with the Army proved to be successful and I recently expanded the number of  agencies involved to include NASA and the Departments of Energy and  Transportation.  
1981_97	1981_97	I firmly believe the critical path to full freedom and equality for  America's minorities rests with the ability of minority communities to  participate competitively in the free enterprise system. I believe the  government has a fundamental responsibility to assist in the development of  minority business and I hope the progress made in the last four years will  continue.  
1981_101	1981_101	As a result of actions my Administration and the Congress have taken over  the past four years, our country finally has a national energy policy:  
1981_106	1981_106	Since 1971 no general federal coal lease sales were suspended. Over the  past four years the Administration has completely revised the federal coal  leasing program to bring it into compliance with the requirements of 1976  Federal Land Planning and Management Act and other statutory provisions.  The program is designed to balance the competing interests that affect  resource development on public lands and to ensure that adequate supplies  of coal will be available to meet national needs. As a result, the first  general competitive federal coal lease sale in ten years will be held this  month.  
1981_107	1981_107	In July 1980, I signed into law the Energy Security Act of 1980 which  established the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. The Corporation is designed to  spur the development of commercial technologies for production of synthetic  fuels, such as liquid and gaseous fuels from coal and the production of oil  from oil shale. The Act provides the Corporation with an initial $22  billion to accomplish these objectives. The principal purpose of the  legislation is to ensure that the nation will have available in the late  1980's the option to undertake commercial development of synthetic fuels if  that becomes necessary. The Energy Security Act also provides significant  incentives for the development of gasohol and biomass fuels, thereby  enhancing the nation's supply of alternative energy sources.  
1981_108	1981_108	COMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE  
1981_109	1981_109	The Administration's 1977 National Energy Plan marked an historic departure  from the policies of previous Administrations. The plan stressed the  importance of both energy production and conservation to achieving our  ultimate national goal of relying primarily on secure sources of energy.  The National Energy Plan made energy conservation a cornerstone of our  national energy policy.  
1981_112	1981_112	COMMITMENT TO NUCLEAR SAFETY AND SECURITY  
1981_115	1981_115	In February 1980, the Administration transmitted its nuclear waste  management policy to the Congress. This policy was a major advance over all  previous efforts. The principal aspects of that policy are: acknowledging  the seriousness of the problem and the numerous technical and institutional  issues; adopting a technically and environmentally conservative approach to  the first permanent repository; and providing the states with significant  involvement in nuclear waste disposal decisions by creating the State  Planning Council. While much of the plan can be and is being implemented  administratively, some new authorities are needed. The Congress should give  early priority to enacting provisions for away_from_reactor storage and the  State Planning Council.  
1981_119	1981_119	III. ENHANCING BASIC HUMAN AND SOCIAL NEEDS  
1981_121	1981_121	Our record has produced clear progress in the effort to solve some of the  country's fundamental human and social problems. My Administration and the  Congress, working together, have demonstrated that government must and can  meet our citizens' basic human and social needs in a responsible and  compassionate way.  
1981_125	1981_125	Nearly 15 million additional poor would receive fully_subsidized  comprehensive coverage; pre_natal and delivery services are provided for  all pregnant women and coverage is provided for all acute care for infants  in their first year of life; the elderly and disabled would have a limit of  $1,250 placed on annual out_of_pocket medical expenses and would no longer  face limits on hospital coverage; all full_time employees and their  families would receive insurance against at least major medical expenses  under mandated employer coverage; Medicare and Medicaid would be combined  and expanded into an umbrella Federal program, Healthcare, for increased  program efficiency, accountability and uniformity; and strong cost  controls and health system reforms would be implemented, including  greater incentives for Health Maintenance Organizations.  
1981_126	1981_126	I urge the new Congress to compare my Plan with the alternatives programs  which either do too little to improve the health care needs of Americans  most in need or programs which would impose substantial financial burdens  on the American taxpayers. I hope the Congress will see the need for and  the benefits of my Plan and work toward prompt enactment. We cannot afford  further delay in this vital area.  
1981_133	1981_133	Ensuring a healthy start in life for children remains not only a high  priority of my Administration, but also one of the most cost effective  forms of health care.  
1981_135	1981_135	Under the National Health Plan I have proposed, there would be no  cost_sharing for prenatal and delivery services for all pregnant women and  for acute care provided to infants in their first year of life. These  preventive services have extremely high returns in terms of improved  newborn and long_term child health.  
1981_140	1981_140	MENTAL HEALTH  
1981_146	1981_146	In the area of accidental injury control, we have established automobile  safety standards and increased enforcement activities with respect to the  55 MPH speed limit. By the end of the decade these actions are expected to  save over 13,000 lives and 100,000 serious injuries each year.  
1981_147	1981_147	I urge the new Congress to continue strong support for all these  activities.  
1981_148	1981_148	FOOD AND NUTRITION  
1981_149	1981_149	Building on the comprehensive reform of the Food Stamp Program that I  proposed and Congress passed in 1977, my Administration and the Congress  worked together in 1979 and 1980 to enact several other important changes  in the Program. These changes will further simplify administration and  reduce fraud and error, will make the program more responsive to the needs  of the elderly and disabled, and will increase the cap on allowable program  expenditures. The Food Stamp Act will expire at the end of fiscal 1981. It  is essential that the new Administration and the Congress continue this  program to ensure complete eradication of the debilitating malnutrition  witnessed and documented among thousands of children in the 1960's.  
1981_151	1981_151	At the beginning of my Administration there were over a half million heroin  addicts in the United States. Our continued emphasis on reducing the supply  of heroin, as well as providing treatment and rehabilitation to its  victims, has reduced the heroin addict population, reduced the number of  heroin overdose deaths by 80%, and reduced the number of heroin related  injuries by 50%. We have also seen and encouraged a national movement of  parents and citizens committed to reversing the very serious and disturbing  trends of adolescent drug abuse.  
1981_159	1981_159	To insure that the education enterprise is ready to meet the scientific and  technological changes of the future, we undertook a major study of the  status of science and engineering education throughout the nation. I hope  that the findings from this report will serve as a springboard for needed  reforms at all levels of education.  
1981_162	1981_162	INCOME SECURITY SOCIAL SECURITY  
1981_171	1981_171	CHILD WELFARE  
1981_173	1981_173	LOW_INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE  
1981_174	1981_174	In 1979 I proposed a program to provide an annual total of $1.6 billion to  low_income households which are hardest hit by rising energy bills. With  the cooperation of Congress, we were able to move quickly to provide  assistance to eligible households in time to meet their winter heating  bills.  
1981_178	1981_178	For the past 14 months, high interest rates have had a severe impact on the  nation's housing market. Yet the current pressures and uncertainties should  not obscure the achievements of the past four years.  
1981_180	1981_180	We have also worked to expand homeownership opportunities for Americans. By  using innovative financing mechanisms, such as the graduated payment  mortgage, we have increased the access of middle income families to housing  credit. By revitalizing the Section 235 program, we have enabled nearly  100,000 moderate income households to purchase new homes. By reducing  paperwork and regulation in Federal programs, and by working with State and  local governments to ease the regulatory burden, we have helped to hold  down housing costs and produce affordable housing.  
1981_186	1981_186	The most important action government can take to meet America's housing  needs is to restore stability to the economy and bring down the rate of  inflation. Inflation has driven up home prices, operating costs and  interest rates. Market uncertainty about inflation has contributed to the  instability in interest rates, which has been an added burden to  homebuilders and homebuyers alike. By making a long_term commitment to  provide a framework for greater investment, sustained economic growth, and  price stability, my Administration has begun the work of creating a healthy  environment for housing.  
1981_188	1981_188	With the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the Motor Carrier  Act of 1980, and the Harley O. Staggers Rail Act of 1980, my  Administration, working with the Congress, has initiated a new era of  reduced regulation of transportation industries. Deregulation will lead to  increased productivity and operating efficiencies in the industries  involved, and stimulate price and service competition, to the benefit of  consumers generally. I urge the new Administration to continue our efforts  on behalf of deregulation legislation for the intercity passenger bus  industry as well.  
1981_192	1981_192	Arresting the deterioration of the nation's system of highways is a high  priority objective for the 1980's. We must reorient the Federal mission  from major new construction projects to the stewardship of the existing  Interstate Highway System. Interstate gaps should be judged on the  connections they make and on their compatibility with community needs.  
1981_200	1981_200	Highway planning and transit planning must be integrated and related to  State, regional, district and neighborhood planning efforts now in place or  emerging. Low density development and land use threaten the fiscal capacity  of many communities to support needed services and infrastructure.  
1981_205	1981_205	In addition, the Federal government must reassess the appropriate Federal  role of support for passenger and freight rail services such as Amtrak and  Conrail. Our goal through federal assistance should be to maintain and  enhance adequate rail service, where it is not otherwise available to needy  communities. But Federal subsidies must be closely scrutinized to be sure  they are a stimulus to, and not a replacement for, private investment and  initiative. Federal assistance cannot mean permanent subsidies for  unprofitable operations.  
1981_207	1981_207	There is a growing need in rural and small communities for improved  transportation services. Rail freight service to many communities has  declined as railroads abandon unproductive branch lines. At the same time,  rural roads are often inadequate to handle large, heavily_loaded trucks.  The increased demand for "harvest to harbor" service has also placed an  increased burden on rural transportation systems, while bottlenecks along  the Mississippi River delay grain shipments to the Gulf of Mexico.  
1981_213	1981_213	There is also a need to modernize and expand the dry bulk segment of our  fleet. Our heavy dependence on foreign carriage of U.S._bulk cargoes  deprives the U.S. economy of seafaring and shipbuilding jobs, adds to the  balance_of_payments deficit, deprives the Government of substantial tax  revenues, and leaves the United States dependent on foreign_flag shipping  for a continued supply of raw materials to support the civil economy and  war production in time of war.  
1981_215	1981_215	During the past year the Administration has stated its support for  legislation that would provide specific Federal assistance for the  installation of fuel_efficient engines in existing American ships, and  would strengthen this country's shipbuilding mobilization base.  Strengthening the fleet is important, but we must also maintain our  shipbuilding base for future ship construction.  
1981_216	1981_216	Provisions in existing laws calling for substantial or exclusive use of  American_flag vessels to carry cargoes generated by the Government must be  vigorously pursued.  
1981_228	1981_228	Private industry will, of course, play a major role in developing the  United States' coal export facilities. The new Administration should  continue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our  access to foreign markets.  
1981_232	1981_232	I have appointed a record number of women to judgeships and to top  government posts. Fully 22 percent of all my appointees are women, and I  nominated 41 of the 46 women who sit on the Federal bench today. For the  first time in our history, women occupy policymaking positions at the  highest level of every Federal agency and department and have demonstrated  their ability to serve our citizens well.  
1981_241	1981_241	The efforts begun for women in employment, business and education should be  continued and strengthened. Money should be available to states to  establish programs to help the victims of domestic violence. Congress  should pass a national health care plan and a welfare reform program, and  these measures should reflect the needs of women.  
1981_242	1981_242	The talents of women should continue to be used to the fullest inside and  outside of government, and efforts should continue to see that they have  the widest range of opportunities and options.  
1981_243	1981_243	HANDICAPPED  
1981_244	1981_244	I hope that my Administration will be remembered in this area for leading  the way toward full civil rights for handicapped Americans. When I took  office, no federal agency had yet issued 504 regulations. As I leave  office, this first step by every major agency and department in the federal  government is almost complete. But it is only a first step. The years ahead  will require steadfast dedication by the President to protect and promote  these precious rights in the classroom, in the workplace, and in all public  facilities so that handicapped individuals may join the American mainstream  and contribute to the fullest their resources and talents to our economic  and social life.  
1981_251	1981_251	OLDER AMERICANS  
1981_253	1981_253	This year, I will be submitting to Congress a budget which again  demonstrates my commitment to programs for the elderly. It will include, as  my previous budgets have, increased funding for nutrition, senior centers  and home health care, and will focus added resources on the needs of older  Americans.  
1981_254	1981_254	With the 1981 White House Conference on Aging approaching, I hope the new  Administration will make every effort to assure an effective and useful  conference. This Conference should enable older Americans to voice their  concerns and give us guidance in our continued efforts to ensure the  quality of life so richly deserved by our senior citizens.  
1981_256	1981_256	We cannot hope to build a just and humane society at home if we ignore the  humanitarian claims of refugees, their lives at stake, who have nowhere  else to turn. Our country can be proud that hundreds of thousands of people  around the world would risk everything they have including their own  lives to come to our country.  
1981_260	1981_260	While we must remain committed to aiding and assisting those who come to  our shores, at the same time we must uphold our immigration and refugee  policies and provide adequate enforcement resources. As a result of our  enforcement policy, the illegal flow from Cuba has been halted and an  orderly process has been initiated to make certain that our refugee and  immigration laws are honored.  
1981_274	1981_274	GENERAL REVENUE SHARING  
1981_276	1981_276	This legislation renewing GRS will be the cornerstone of  Federal_State_local government relations in the 1980's. This policy will  emphasize the need for all levels of government to cooperate in order to  meet the needs of the most fiscally strained cities and counties, and also  will emphasize the important role that GRS can play in forging this  partnership. I am grateful that Congress moved quickly to assure that our  Nation's localities can begin the 1980's in sound fiscal condition.  
1981_279	1981_279	URBAN POLICY  
1981_282	1981_282	One of the principal goals of my domestic policy has been to strengthen the  private sector economic base of our Nation's economically troubled urban  and rural areas. With Congress' cooperation, we have substantially expanded  the Federal government's economic development programs and provided new tax  incentives for private investment in urban and rural communities. These  programs have helped many communities to attract new private sector jobs  and investments and to retain the jobs and investments that already are in  place.  
1981_285	1981_285	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  
1981_287	1981_287	Last year, Congress reauthorized both the CDBG and UDAG programs. The CDBG  program was reauthorized for three more years with annual funding increases  of $150 million, and the UDAG program was extended for three years at the  current funding level of $675 million annually. My 1982 budget requests  full funding for both of these programs. These actions should help our  Nation's cities and counties to continue the progress they have made in the  last three years.  
1981_290	1981_290	The Federal government will need to develop more innovative and practical  ways for neighborhood based organizations to successfully participate in  the identification and solution of local and neighborhood concerns. Full  partnership will only be achieved with the knowing participation of leaders  of government, business, education and unions. Neither state nor Federal  solutions imposed from on high will suffice. Neighborhoods are the fabric  and soul of this great land. Neighborhoods define the weave that has been  used to create a permanent fabric. The Federal government must take every  opportunity to provide access and influence to the individuals and  organizations affected at the neighborhood level.  
1981_293	1981_293	In December, 1979, I announced the Small Community and Rural Development  Policy. It was the culmination of several years' work and was designed to  address the varying needs of our rural population. In 1980, my  Administration worked with the Congress to pass the Rural Development  Policy Act of 1980, which when fully implemented will allow us to meet the  needs of rural people and their communities more effectively and more  efficiently.  
1981_297	1981_297	 Worked with more than 40 governors to form State rural development  councils to work in partnership with the White House Working Group, and the  Federal agencies, to better deliver State and Federal programs to rural  areas.  
1981_300	1981_300	With the help and dedication of a great many people around the country who  are concerned with rural affairs, we have constructed a mechanism for  dealing effectively with rural problems. There is now a great opportunity  to successfully combine Federal efforts with the efforts of rural community  leaders and residents. It is my hope this spirit of cooperation and record  of accomplishment will be continued in the coming years.  
1981_305	1981_305	Science and Technology  
1981_307	1981_307	The Federal government has a special role to play in science and  technology. Although the fruits of scientific achievements surround us, it  is often difficult to predict the benefits that will arise from a given  scientific venture. And these benefits, even if predictable, do not usually  lead to ownership rights. Accordingly, the Government has a special  obligation to support science as an investment in our future.  
1981_319	1981_319	THE ARTS  
1981_322	1981_322	It is my hope that during the coming years the new Administration and the  Congress will:  
1981_324	1981_324	 Encourage business participants in a comprehensive effort to achieve a  truly mixed economy of support for the arts;  
1981_325	1981_325	 Explore a variety of mechanisms to nurture the creative talent of our  citizens and build audiences for their work;  
1981_326	1981_326	 Support strong, active National Endowments for the Arts;  
1981_327	1981_327	 Seek greater recognition for the rich cultural tradition of the nation's  minorities;  
1981_328	1981_328	 Provide grants for the arts in low_income neighborhoods.  
1981_331	1981_331	I believe we are in agreement that the humanities illuminate the values  underlying important personal, social, and national questions raised in our  society by its multiple links to and increasing dependence on technology,  and by the diverse heritage of our many regions and ethnic groups. The  humanities cast light on the broad issue of the role in a society of men  and women of imagination and energy those individuals who through their  own example define "the spirit of the age," and in so doing move nations.  Our Government's support for the humanities, within the framework laid down  by the Congress, is a recognition of their essential nourishment of the  life of the mind and vital enrichment of our national life.  
1981_332	1981_332	I will be proposing an increase in funding this year sufficient to enable  the Endowment to maintain the same level of support offered our citizens in  Fiscal Year 1981.  
1981_333	1981_333	In the allocation of this funding, special emphasis will be given to:  
1981_334	1981_334	 Humanities education in the nation's schools, in response to the great  needs that have arisen in this area;  
1981_335	1981_335	 Scholarly research designed to increase our understanding of the  cultures, traditions, and historical forces at work in other nations and in  our own;  
1981_337	1981_337	 The dissemination of quality programming in the humanities to  increasingly large American audiences through the use of radio and  television.  
1981_345	1981_345	CIVIL SERVICE REFORM  
1981_347	1981_347	In 1981, civil service reform faces critical challenges, all agencies must  have fully functioning performance appraisal systems for all employees, and  merit pay systems for compensating the government's 130,000 GS_13_15  managers. Performance bonuses for members of the Senior Executive Service  will surely receive scrutiny. If this attention is balanced and  constructive, it can only enhance the chances for ultimate success of our  bipartisan commitment to the revolutionary and crucial "pay for  performance" concept.  
1981_349	1981_349	During the past four years we have made tremendous progress in regulatory  reform. We have discarded old economic regulations that prevented  competition and raised consumer costs, and we have imposed strong  management principles on the regulatory programs the country needs, cutting  paperwork and other wasteful burdens. The challenge for the future is to  continue the progress in both areas without crippling vital health and  safety programs.  
1981_351	1981_351	Airlines: The Airline Deregulation Act is generating healthy competition,  saving billions in fares, and making the airlines more efficient. The Act  provides that in 1985 the CAB itself will go out of existence.  
1981_352	1981_352	Trucking: The trucking deregulation bill opens the industry to competition  and allows truckers wide latitude on the routes they drive and the goods  they haul. The bill also phases out most of the old law's immunity for  setting rates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these reforms will  save as much as $8 billion per year and cut as much as half a percentage  point from the inflation rate.  
1981_355	1981_355	Recently, I submitted to the Congress my Administration's recommendations  for the phased liberalization of restrictions on geographic expansion by  commercial banks. Last year the Administration and financial regulatory  agencies proposed legislation to permit the interstate acquisition of  failing depository institutions. In view of the difficult outlook for some  depository institutions I strongly urge the Congress to take prompt  favorable action on the failing bank legislation.  
1981_357	1981_357	While these initiatives represent dramatic progress in economic  deregulation, continued work is needed. I urge Congress to act on  communications legislation and to consider other proposed deregulation  measures, such as legislation on the bus industry. In addition, the  regulatory commissions must maintain their commitment to competition as the  best regulator of all.  
1981_359	1981_359	These steps have already saved billions of dollars in regulatory costs and  slashed thousands of outmoded regulations. We are moving steadily toward a  regulatory system that provides needed protections fairly, predictably, and  at minimum cost.  
1981_364	1981_364	TIGHTENING STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY AND INTEGRITY  
1981_366	1981_366	To streamline the structure of the government, we have secured approval of  14 reorganization initiatives, improving the efficiency of the most  important sectors of the government, including energy, education, and civil  rights enforcement. We have eliminated more than 300 advisory committees as  well as other agencies, boards and commissions which were obsolete or  ineffective. Independent Inspectors General have been appointed in major  agencies to attack fraud and waste. More than a billion dollars of  questionable transactions have been identified through their audit  activities.  
1981_370	1981_370	 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of  Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) have been reorganized and strengthened  and a permanent civil rights unit has been established in OMB.  
1981_378	1981_378	EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT  
1981_379	1981_379	I remain committed as strongly as possible to the ratification of the Equal  Rights Amendment.  
1981_381	1981_381	Although the Congress has no official role in the ratification process at  this point, you do have the ability to affect public opinion and the  support of State Legislators for the Amendment. I urge Members from States  which have not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to use their  influence to secure ratification. I will continue my own efforts to help  ensure ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  
1981_382	1981_382	MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  
1981_385	1981_385	The Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1980 passed the House of Representatives  by an overwhelming bipartisan majority only to die in the Senate at the  close of the 96th Congress. The leaders of both parties have pledged to  make the enactment of fair housing legislation a top priority of the  incoming Congress. The need is pressing and a strengthened federal  enforcement effort must be the primary method of resolution.  
1981_388	1981_388	PRIVACY  
1981_390	1981_390	In the past four years we acted on the report of the Privacy Commission and  established a national privacy policy. We worked with Congress to pass  legislation restricting wiretaps and law enforcement access to bank records  and to reporters' files. We reduced the number of personal files held by  the government and restricted the transfer of personal information among  Federal agencies. We also worked with the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development to establish international guidelines to  protect the privacy of personal information that is transferred across  borders.  
1981_392	1981_392	Two of our Nation's most precious natural resources are our environment and  our vast agricultural capacity. From the beginning of my Administration, I  have worked with the Congress to enhance and protect, as well as develop  our natural resources. In the environmental areas, I have been especially  concerned about the importance of balancing the need for resource  development with preserving a clean environment, and have taken numerous  actions to foster this goal. In the agricultural area, I have taken the  steps needed to improve farm incomes and to increase our agricultural  production to record levels. That progress must be continued in the 1980's.  
1981_393	1981_393	ENVIRONMENT  
1981_397	1981_397	The Act adds 97 million acres of new parks and refuges, more than doubling  the size of our National Park and National Wildlife Refuge Systems. The  bill triples the size of our national wilderness system, increasing its  size by 56 million acres. And by adding 25 free_flowing river segments to  the Wild and Scenic River System, the bill almost doubles the river mileage  in that system. The Alaska Lands Act reaffirms our commitment to the  environment and strikes a balance between protecting areas of great beauty  and allowing development of Alaska's oil, gas, mineral, and timber  resources.  
1981_398	1981_398	PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES  
1981_403	1981_403	 to consider environmental requirements and values more fully and along  with economic factors in the planning and management of water projects and  programs;  
1981_404	1981_404	 to enhance cooperation between state and federal agencies in water  resources planning and management.  
1981_406	1981_406	In the pursuit of this policy, however, we cannot lose projects. In the  part that sound water resource projects play in providing irrigation,  power, and flood control. We must also recognize the special needs of  particular regions of the country in evaluating the need for additional  projects.  
1981_407	1981_407	ADDRESSING GLOBAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS  
1981_409	1981_409	The Report's conclusions are important. They point to a rapid increase in  population and human needs through the year 2000 while at the same time a  decline in the earth's capacity to meet those needs, unless nations of the  world act decisively to alter current trends.  
1981_414	1981_414	Second, the administration established a hazardous waste enforcement strike  force to ensure that when available, responsible parties are required to  clean up sites posing dangers to public health and to the environment. To  date, 50 lawsuits have been brought by the strike force.  
1981_416	1981_416	THE FUTURE  
1981_421	1981_421	 that we put this nation on a path to a sustainable energy future, one  based increasingly on renewable resources and on energy conservation;  
1981_426	1981_426	AGRICULTURE THE FARM ECONOMY  
1981_429	1981_429	Through a combination of improvements in old, established programs and the  adoption of new approaches where innovation and change were needed, my  Administration turned this situation around. Commodity prices have steadily  risen. Farm income turned upward. U.S. farm exports set new records each  year, increasing over 80 percent for the four year period. Livestock  producers began rebuilding their herds. Dairy farmers began to earn a  profit again.  
1981_433	1981_433	The Congress authorized formation of a 4 million ton food grain reserve for  use in international food assistance. This reserve makes it possible for  the United States to stand behind its food aid commitment to food deficit  nations, even during periods of short supplies and high prices. This  corrects a serious fault in our past food assistance policy.  
1981_436	1981_436	SPECIAL LOAN RATES  
1981_437	1981_437	Another legislative measure passed late in the 2nd session of the 96th  Congress authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide higher loan  rates to farmers who enter their grain in the farmer_owned grain reserve.  This additional incentive to participate will further strengthen the  reserve.  
1981_444	1981_444	Beyond this, it will be important for the Congress to keep a close eye on  price_cost developments in the farm sector. As noted above, some of the  actions I took last year were for the purpose of providing relief from the  cost_price squeeze facing farmers. Should these pressures continue, further  actions might be required.  
1981_446	1981_446	Following a careful review of the situation, I recently extended the  suspension of grain sales to the Soviet Union. I am satisfied that this  action has served its purpose effectively and fairly. However, as long as  this suspension must remain in effect, it will be important for the next  Administration and the Congress to take whatever actions are necessary to  ensure that the burden does not fall unfairly on our Nation's farmers. This  has been a key feature of my Administration's policy, and it should be  maintained.  
1981_447	1981_447	VII. FOREIGN POLICY  
1981_448	1981_448	From the time I assumed office four years ago this month, I have stressed  the need for this country to assert a leading role in a world undergoing  the most extensive and intensive change in human history.  
1981_449	1981_449	My policies have been directed in particular at three areas of change:  
1981_457	1981_457	 We have helped to bring about a dramatic improvement in relations  between Egypt and Israel and an historic step towards a comprehensive  Arab_Israeli settlement.  
1981_464	1981_464	We face a broad range of threats and opportunities. We have and should  continue to pursue a broad range of defense, diplomatic and economic  capabilities and objectives.  
1981_467	1981_467	 Second, we will pursue an active diplomacy in the world, working,  together with our friends and allies, to resolve disputes through peaceful  means and to make any aggressor pay a heavy price.  
1981_468	1981_468	 Third, we will strive to resolve pressing international economic  problems, particularly energy and inflation, and continue to pursue our  still larger objective of global economic growth through expanded trade and  development assistance and through the preservation of an open multilateral  trading system.  
1981_470	1981_470	 Fifth, we remain deeply committed to the process of mutual and  verifiable arms control, particularly to the effort to prevent the spread  and further development of nuclear weapons. Our decision to defer, but not  abandon our efforts to secure ratification of the SALT II Treaty reflects  our firm conviction that the United States has a profound national  security interest in the constraints on Soviet nuclear forces which only  that treaty can provide.  
1981_471	1981_471	 Sixth, we must continue to look ahead in order to evaluate and respond  to resource, environment and population challenges through the end of this  century.  
1981_472	1981_472	One very immediate and pressing objective that is uppermost on our minds  and those of the American people is the release of our hostages in Iran.  
1981_476	1981_476	The maintenance of national security is my first concern, as it has been  for every president before me.  
1981_480	1981_480	We are demonstrating to the Soviet Union across a broad front that it will  pay a heavy price for its aggression in terms of our relationship.  Throughout the last decades U.S._Soviet relations have been a mixture of  cooperation and competition. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the  imposition of a puppet government have highlighted in the starkest terms  the darker side of their policies, going well beyond competition and the  legitimate pursuit of national interest, and violating all norms of  international law and practice.  
1981_481	1981_481	This attempt to subjugate an independent, non_aligned Islamic people is a  callous violation of international law and the United Nations Charter, two  fundamentals of international order. Hence, it is also a dangerous threat  to world peace. For the first time since the communization of Eastern  Europe after World War II, the Soviets have sent combat forces into an area  that was not previously under their control, into a non_aligned and  sovereign state.  
1981_482	1981_482	The destruction of the independence of the Afghanistan government and the  occupation by the Soviet Union have altered the strategic situation in that  part of the world in a very ominous fashion. It has significantly shortened  the striking distance to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf for the  Soviet Union.  
1981_487	1981_487	BILATERAL COMMUNICATION  
1981_488	1981_488	U.S._Soviet relations remain strained by the continued Soviet presence in  Afghanistan, by growing Soviet military capabilities, and by the Soviets'  apparent willingness to use those capabilities without respect for the most  basic norms of international behavior.  
1981_492	1981_492	DEFENSE BUDGET  
1981_494	1981_494	The Soviet Union has built a war machine far beyond any reasonable  requirements for their own defense and security. In contrast, our own  defense spending declined in real terms every year from 1968 through 1976.  
1981_495	1981_495	We have reversed this decline in our own effort. Every year since 1976  there has been a real increase in our defense spending, and our lead has  encouraged increases by our allies. With the support of the Congress, we  must and will make an even greater effort in the years ahead.  
1981_496	1981_496	The Fiscal Year 1982 budget would increase funding authority for defense to  more than $196 billion. This amount, together with a supplemental request  for FY 1981 of about $6 billion, will more than meet my Administration's  pledge for a sustained growth of 3 percent in real expenditures, and  provides for 5 percent in program growth in FY 1982 and beyond.  
1981_499	1981_499	The defense program emphasizes four areas:  
1981_504	1981_504	The new M_X missile program to enhance our land_based intercontinental  ballistic missile force continues to make progress. Technical refinements  in the basing design over the last year will result in operational  benefits, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact. The M_X program  continues to be an essential ingredient in our strategic posture, providing  survivability, endurance, secure command and control and the capability to  threaten targets the Soviets hold dear.  
1981_508	1981_508	I have codified our evolving strategic doctrine in a number of interrelated  and mutually supporting Presidential Directives. Their overarching theme is  to provide a doctrinal basis, and the specific program to implement it,  that tells the world that no potential adversary of the United States could  ever conclude that the fruits of his aggression would be significant or  worth the enormous costs of our retaliation.  
1981_509	1981_509	The Presidential Directives include:  
1981_510	1981_510	PD_18: An overview of our strategic objectives PD_37: Basic space policy  PD_41: Civil Defense PD_53: Survivability and endurance for  telecommunications PD_57: Mobilization planning PD_58: Continuity of  Government PD_59: Countervailing Strategy for General War.  
1981_512	1981_512	But at the same time we in no way seek to emulate their doctrine. In  particular, nothing in our policy contemplates that nuclear warfare could  ever be a deliberate instrument for achieving our own goals of peace and  freedom. Moreover, our policies are carefully devised to provide the  greatest possible incentives and opportunities for future progress in arms  control.  
1981_514	1981_514	FORCES FOR NATO  
1981_516	1981_516	We are prepositioning more heavy equipment in Europe to help us cope with  attacks with little warning, and greatly strengthening our airlift and  sealift capabilities.  
1981_518	1981_518	We are working closely with our European allies to secure the Host Nation  Support necessary to enable us to deploy more quickly a greater ratio of  combat forces to the European theater at a lower cost to the United  States.  
1981_536	1981_536	OUR INTELLIGENCE POSTURE  
1981_538	1981_538	The intelligence budget I have submitted to the Congress responds to our  needs in a responsible way, providing for significant growth over the  Fiscal Year 1981 budget. This growth will enable us to develop new  technical means of intelligence collection while also assuring that the  more traditional methods of intelligence work are also given proper stress.  We must continue to integrate both modes of collection in our analyses.  
1981_539	1981_539	REGIONAL POLICIES  
1981_542	1981_542	We have vital stakes in other major regions of the world as well. We have  long recognized that in an era of interdependence, our own security and  prosperity depend upon a larger common effort with friends and allies  throughout the world.  
1981_545	1981_545	The U.S. has not been alone in seeking to maintain stability in the  Southwest Asia area and insure access to the needed resources there. The  European nations with the capability to do so are improving their own  forces in the region and providing greater economic and political support  to the residents of the area. In the face of the potential danger posed by  the Iran_Iraq conflict, we have developed coordination among the Western  forces in the area of the Persian Gulf in order to be able to safeguard  passage in that essential waterway.  
1981_547	1981_547	The alliance has continued to build on the progress of the past three years  in improving its conventional forces through the Long_Term Defense Program.  Though economic conditions throughout Europe today are making its  achievement difficult, the yearly real increase of 3 percent in defense  spending remains a goal actively sought by the alliance.  
1981_548	1981_548	The NATO alliance also has moved forward during the past year with the  implementation of its historic December 1979 decision to modernize its  Theater Nuclear Force capabilities through deployment of improved Pershing  ballistic missiles and ground_launched cruise missiles in Europe. Our  allies continue to cooperate actively with us in this important joint  endeavor, whose purpose is to demonstrate convincingly to the Soviet Union  the potential costs of a nuclear conflict in Europe. At the same time, we  offered convincing evidence of our commitment to arms control in Europe by  initiating preliminary consultations with the Soviet Union in Geneva on the  subject of negotiated limits on long_range theater nuclear forces. Also,  during 1980 we initiated and carried out a withdrawal from our nuclear  weapons stockpile in Europe of 1,000 nuclear warheads. This successful  drawdown in our nuclear stockpile was a further tangible demonstration of  our commitment to the updating of our existing theater nuclear forces in  Europe.  
1981_549	1981_549	In the NATO area, we continued to work closely with other countries in  providing resources to help Turkey regain economic health. We regretted  that massive political and internal security problems led the Turkish  military to take over the government on September 12. The new Turkish  authorities are making some progress in resolving those problems, and they  have pledged an early return to civilian government. The tradition of the  Turkish military gives us cause to take that pledge seriously. We welcomed  the reestablishment of Greece's links to the integrated military command  structure of the Atlantic Alliance a move which we had strongly  encouraged as a major step toward strengthening NATO's vital southern  flank at a time of international crisis and tension in adjacent areas.  Greek reintegration exemplifies the importance which the allies place on  cooperating in the common defense and shows that the allies can make the  difficult decisions necessary to insure their continued security. We also  welcomed the resumption of the intercommunal talks on Cyprus.  
1981_558	1981_558	Finally, we are in the process of concluding a long negotiation  establishing Micronesia's status as a freely associated state.  
1981_560	1981_560	THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTHWEST ASIA  
1981_563	1981_563	MIDDLE EAST  
1981_568	1981_568	PERSIAN GULF  
1981_569	1981_569	The Persian Gulf has been a vital crossroads for trade between Europe and  Asia at many key moments in history. It has become essential in recent  years for its supply of oil to the United States, our allies, and our  friends. We have taken effective measures to control our own consumption of  imported fuel, working in cooperation with the other key industrial /  nations of the world. However, there is little doubt that the healthy  growth of our American and world economies will depend for many years on  continued safe access to the Persian Gulf's oil production. The denial of  these oil supplies would threaten not only our own but world security.  
1981_573	1981_573	We seek a South Asia comprising sovereign and stable states, free of  outside interference, which can strengthen their political institutions  according to their own national genius and can develop their economies for  the betterment of their people.  
1981_579	1981_579	The United States has achieved a new level of trust and cooperation with  Africa. Our efforts, together with our allies, to achieve peace in southern  Africa, our increased efforts to help the poorest countries in Africa to  combat poverty, and our expanded efforts to promote trade and investment  have led to growing respect for the U.S. and to cooperation in areas of  vital interest to the United States.  
1981_580	1981_580	Africa is a continent of poor nations for the most part. It also contains  many of the mineral resources vital for our economy. We have worked with  Africa in a spirit of mutual cooperation to help the African nations solve  their problems of poverty and to develop stronger ties between our private  sector and African economies. Our assistance to Africa has more than  doubled in the last four years. Equally important, we set in motion new  mechanisms for private investment and trade.  
1981_582	1981_582	During Vice President Mondale's visit, a Joint Agricultural Consultative  Committee was established, with the U.S. represented entirely by the  private sector. This could herald a new role for the American private  sector in helping solve the world's serious food shortages. I am pleased to  say that our relations with Nigeria are at an all_time high, providing the  foundation for an even stronger relationship in the years ahead.  
1981_584	1981_584	In southern Africa the United States continues to pursue a policy of  encouraging peaceful development toward majority rule. In 1980, Southern  Rhodesia became independent as Zimbabwe, a multiracial nation under a  system of majority rule. Zimbabwean independence last April was the  culmination of a long struggle within the country and diplomatic efforts  involving Great Britain, African states neighboring Zimbabwe, and the  United States.  
1981_586	1981_586	In response to our active concern with issues of importance to Africans,  African states have cooperated with us on issues of importance to our  national interests. African states voted overwhelmingly in favor of the  U.N. Resolution calling for release of the hostages, and for the U.N.  Resolution condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Two countries of  Africa have signed access agreements with the U.S. allowing us use of naval  and air facilities in the Indian Ocean.  
1981_587	1981_587	Africans have become increasingly vocal on human rights. African leaders  have spoken out on the issue of political prisoners, and the OAU is  drafting its own Charter on Human Rights. Three countries in Africa   Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda have returned to civilian rule during the past  year.  
1981_588	1981_588	U.S. cooperation with Africa on all these matters represents a strong base  on which we can build in future years.  
1981_591	1981_591	In early 1979, following a Libyan_inspired commando attack on a Tunisian  provincial city, the U.S. responded promptly to Tunisia's urgent request  for assistance, both by airlifting needed military equipment and by making  clear our longstanding interest in the security and integrity of this  friendly country. The U.S. remains determined to oppose other irresponsible  Libyan aspirations. Despairing of a productive dialogue with the Libyan  authorities, the U.S. closed down its embassy in Libya and later expelled  six Libyan diplomats in Washington in order to deter an intimidation  campaign against Libyan citizens in the U.S.  
1981_595	1981_595	The principles of our policies in this hemisphere have been clear and  constant over the last four years. We support democracy and respect for  human rights. We have struggled with many to help free the region of both  repression and terrorism. We have respected ideological diversity and  opposed outside intervention in purely internal affairs. We will act,  though, in response to a request for assistance by a country threatened by  external aggression. We support social and economic development within a  democratic framework. We support the peaceful settlement of disputes. We  strongly encourage regional cooperation and shared responsibilities within  the hemisphere to all these ends, and we have eagerly and regularly sought  the advice of the leaders of the region on a wide range of issues.  
1981_598	1981_598	The trend in favor of democracy has continued. During this past year, Peru  inaugurated a democratically elected government. Brazil continues its  process of liberalization. In Central America, Hondurans voted in record  numbers in their first national elections in over eight years. In the  Caribbean seven elections have returned governments firmly committed to the  democratic traditions of the Commonwealth.  
1981_602	1981_602	In 1980, relations with Mexico continued to improve due in large measure to  the effectiveness of the Coordinator for Mexican Affairs and the expanded  use of the U.S._Mexico Consultative Mechanism. By holding periodic meetings  of its various working groups, we have been able to prevent mutual concerns  from becoming political issues. The Secretary of State visited Mexico City  in November, and, along with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations,  reviewed the performance of the Consultative Mechanism. The office of the  Coordinator has ensured the implementation of my directive to all agencies  to accord high priority to Mexican concerns. Trade with Mexico rose by  almost 60 percent to nearly $30 billion, making that country our third  largest trading partner.  
1981_605	1981_605	We have a long_standing treaty with Colombia on Quita Sueno, Roncador, and  Serrano which remains to be ratified by the Senate.  
1981_608	1981_608	We have increased our aid to the Caribbean, an area vital to our national  security, and we should continue to build close relations based on mutual  respect and understanding, and common interests.  
1981_613	1981_613	Last year, the war between Iraq and Iran led to the loss of nearly 4  million barrels of oil to world markets, the third major oil market  disruption in the past seven years. This crisis has vividly demonstrated  once again both the value of lessened dependence on oil imports and the  continuing instability of the Persian Gulf area.  
1981_615	1981_615	Our international cooperation efforts in the energy field are not limited  to crisis management. At the Economic Summit meetings in Tokyo and Venice,  the heads of government of the seven major industrial democracies agreed to  a series of tough energy conservation and production goals. We are working  together with all our allies and friends in this effort.  
1981_617	1981_617	We are working cooperatively with other nations to increase energy security  in other areas as well. Joint research and development with our allies is  underway in solar energy, nuclear power, industrial conservation and other  areas. In addition, we are assisting rapidly industrializing nations to  carefully assess their basic energy policy choices, and our development  assistance program helps the developing countries to increase indigenous  energy production to meet the energy needs of their poorest citizens. We  support the proposal for a new World Bank energy affiliate to these same  ends, whose fulfillment will contribute to a better global balance between  energy supply and demand.  
1981_623	1981_623	COFFEE  
1981_624	1981_624	At year's end, Congress approved implementing legislation permitting the  U.S. to carry out fully its commitments under International Coffee  Agreement Specifically, the legislation enables us to meet our part of an  understanding negotiated last fall among members of the Agreement, which  defends, by use of export quotas, a price range well below coffee prices of  previous years and which commits major coffee producers to eliminate cartel  arrangements that manipulated future markets to raise prices. The way is  now open to a fully_functioning International Coffee Agreement which can  help to stabilize this major world commodity market. The results will be  positive for both consumers who will be less likely to suffer from sharp  increases in coffee prices and producers who can undertake future  investment with assurance of greater protection against disruptive price  fluctuations in their exports.  
1981_625	1981_625	NATURAL RUBBER  
1981_629	1981_629	ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS  
1981_630	1981_630	Our relations with the developing nations are of major importance to the  United States. The fabric of our relations with these countries has strong  economic and political dimensions. They constitute the most rapidly growing  markets for our exports, and are important sources of fuel and raw  materials. Their political views are increasingly important, as  demonstrated in their overwhelming condemnation of the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan. Our ability to work together with developing nations toward  goals we have in common (their political independence, the resolution of  regional tensions, and our growing ties of trade for example) require us to  maintain the policy of active involvement with the developing world that we  have pursued over the past four years.  
1981_632	1981_632	Our proposed FY 1982 bilateral development aid program is directly  responsive to the agreement reached at the 1980 Venice Economic Summit that  the major industrial nations should increase their aid for food and energy  production and for family planning. We understand that other Summit  countries plan similar responses. It is also important to honor our  international agreements for multilateral assistance by authorizing and  appropriating funds for the International Financial Institutions. These  multilateral programs enhance the efficiency of U.S. contributions by  combining them with those of many other donor countries to promote  development; the proposed new World Bank affiliate to increase energy  output in developing countries offers particular promise. All these types  of aid benefit our long_run economic and political interests.  
1981_633	1981_633	Progress was made on a number of economic issues in negotiations throughout  the U.N. system. However, in spite of lengthy efforts in the United  Nations, agreement has not been reached on how to launch a process of  Global Negotiations in which nations might collectively work to solve such  important issues as energy, food, protectionism, and population pressures.  The United States continues to believe that progress can best be made when  nations focus on such specific problems, rather than on procedural and  institutional questions. It will continue to work to move the North_South  dialogue into a more constructive phase.  
1981_638	1981_638	Good progress has been made since the Venice Economic Summit called for  increased effort on this front. We and other donor countries have begun to  assist poor countries develop long_term strategies to improve their food  production. The World Bank will invest up to $4 billion in the next few  years in improving the grain storage and food_handling capacity of  countries prone to food shortages.  
1981_643	1981_643	The human rights policy of the United States has been an integral part of  our overall foreign policy for the past several years. This policy serves  the national interest of the United States in several important ways: by  encouraging respect by governments for the basic rights of human beings, it  promotes peaceful, constructive change, reduces the likelihood of internal  pressures for violent change and for the exploitation of these by our  adversaries, and thus directly serves our long_term interest in peace and  stability; by matching espousal of fundamental American principles of  freedom with specific foreign policy actions, we stand out in vivid  contrast to our ideological adversaries; by our efforts to expand freedom  elsewhere, we render our own freedom, and our own nation, more secure.  Countries that respect human rights make stronger allies and better  friends.  
1981_644	1981_644	Rather than attempt to dictate what system of government or institutions  other countries should have, the U.S. supports, throughout the world, the  internationally recognized human rights which all members of the United  Nations have pledged themselves to respect. There is more than one model  that can satisfy the continuing human reach for freedom and justice:  
1981_645	1981_645	1980 has been a year of some disappointments, but has also seen some  positive developments in the ongoing struggle for fulfillment of human  rights throughout the world. In the year we have seen:  
1981_653	1981_653	HUMANITARIAN AID  
1981_655	1981_655	The great majority of refugee admissions continued to be from Indo_china.  During 1980, 168,000 Indo_chinese were resettled in the United States.  Although refugee populations persist in camps in Southeast Asia, and  refugees continue to flee Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea, the flow is not as  great as in the past. One factor in reducing the flow from Vietnam has been  the successful negotiation and commencement of an Orderly Departure Program  which permits us to process Vietnamese for resettlement in the United  States with direct departure from Ho Chi Minh Ville in an orderly fashion.  The first group of 250 departed Vietnam for the United States in December,  1980.  
1981_656	1981_656	In addition to the refugees admitted last year, the United States accepted  for entry into the United States 125,000 Cubans who were expelled by Fidel  Castro. Federal and state authorities, as well as private voluntary  agencies, responded with unprecedented vigor to coping with the unexpected  influx of Cubans.  
1981_664	1981_664	Thus one of the central objectives of my Administration has been to control  the proliferation of nuclear weapons to those nations which do not have  them, and their further development by the existing nuclear powers   notably the Soviet Union and the United States.  
1981_668	1981_668	 First, we have been seeking to encourage nations to accede to the  Non_Proliferation Treaty. The U.S. is also actively encouraging other  nations to accept full_scope safeguards on all of their nuclear activities  and is asking other nuclear suppliers to adopt a full_scope safeguards  requirement as a condition for future supply.  
1981_669	1981_669	 Second, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE), which  was completed in 1980, demonstrated that suppliers and recipients can work  together on these technically complex and sensitive issues. While  differences remain, the INFCE effort provides a broader international basis  for national decisions which must balance energy needs with  non_proliferation concerns.  
1981_672	1981_672	I remain convinced that the SALT II Treaty is in our Nation's security  interest and that it would add significantly to the control of nuclear  weapons. I strongly support continuation of the SALT process and the  negotiation of more far_reaching mutual restraints on nuclear weaponry.  
1981_675	1981_675	We must move together into this decade with the strength which comes from  realization of the dangers before us and from the confidence that together  we can overcome them.  The White House, January 16, 1981.  
1982_5	1982_5	When I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington, critical  of past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new spirit of  partnership between this Congress and this administration and between  Washington and our State and local governments. In forging this new  partnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our  Republic prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessings  of individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all of humanity.  
1982_6	1982_6	It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in  our relations with other nations, on the foundation we've carefully laid  for our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited initiative  that I believe can change the face of American government and make it again  the servant of the people.  
1982_7	1982_7	Seldom have the stakes been higher for America. What we do and say here  will make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in the  Northwest, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines;  to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard_pressed farmers and small  businessmen; and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simple  wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children. To  understand the state of the Union, we must look not only at where we are  and where we're going but where we've been. The situation at this time last  year was truly ominous.  
1982_10	1982_10	Late in 1981 we sank into the present recession, largely because continued  high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction. And there was  a drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment increased.  
1982_13	1982_13	There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our  administration and this Congress. It was said we could never work together.  Well, those predictions were wrong. The record is clear, and I believe that  history will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember this  administration as an administration of change, and remember this Congress  as a Congress of destiny.  
1982_15	1982_15	Together, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people  in their States and local communities, we have started returning power and  resources to them.  
1982_17	1982_17	Together, we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat waste  and fraud in government. In just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers more  than $2 billion, and it's only getting started.  
1982_18	1982_18	Together we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate  wasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of  Americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social  problems.  
1982_19	1982_19	Together we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures  peace. Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride.  
1982_20	1982_20	Together we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun.  
1982_21	1982_21	No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy. In my Inaugural Address  last year, I warned that the "ills we suffer have come upon us over several  decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go  away . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had it  in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and  greatest bastion of freedom."  
1982_23	1982_23	And so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now? Well, two  things. First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the  economy. Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program  that's only just now getting underway, as some would have you believe; they  are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend.  
1982_25	1982_25	The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to  the policies that gave us a trillion_dollar debt, runaway inflation,  runaway interest rates and unemployment. The doubters would have us turn  back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax rate  reductions already passed by this Congress. Raise present taxes to cut  future deficits, they tell us. Well, I don't believe we should buy that  argument.  
1982_27	1982_27	As it now stands, our forecast, which we're required by law to make, will  show major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars and  declining, but still too high. More important, we're making progress with  the three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower interest rates,  and spending control. The policies we have in place will reduce the deficit  steadily, surely, and in time, completely.  
1982_28	1982_28	Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits. If they did, how would we  explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976; yet in that  same 6_year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history. In  1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion, and in 1980 we had one of our  all_time biggest deficits. Raising taxes won't balance the budget; it will  encourage more government spending and less private investment. Raising  taxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy future  jobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more  likely that those who now have jobs could lose them. So, I will not ask you  to try to balance the budget on the backs of the American taxpayers.  
1982_30	1982_30	Now, the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations. The  recession did that. It lowered revenues and increased costs. To some  extent, we're also victims of our own success. We've brought inflation down  faster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we've deprived  government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people  into higher income tax brackets. And the continued high interest rates last  year cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.  
1982_41	1982_41	I am confident the economic program we've put into operation will protect  the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans. It  will stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capital  for expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, and jobs for the unemployed.  
1982_44	1982_44	In 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs, costing  $7 billion. When I took office, there were approximately 500, costing  nearly a hundred billion dollars 13 programs for energy, 36 for pollution  control, 66 for social services, 90 for education. And here in the  Congress, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of  them.  
1982_45	1982_45	You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can  properly oversee this jungle of grants_in_aid; indeed, the growth of these  grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government. As  one Democratic Governor put it recently: The National Government should be  worrying about "arms control, not potholes."  
1982_48	1982_48	Starting in fiscal 1984, the Federal Government will assume full  responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to go  along with its existing responsibility for Medicare. As part of a  financially equal swap, the States will simultaneously take full  responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps.  This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need,  because it'll be designed and administered closer to the grass roots and  the people it serves.  
1982_50	1982_50	By 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grant  programs. The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to disappear,  and the excise taxes will be turned over to the States. They can then  preserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these  programs as they see fit.  
1982_51	1982_51	In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end  cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while we  ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they're  meant to help and the people who pay for them.  
1982_58	1982_58	So, too, the problem of crime one as real and deadly serious as any in  America today. It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system,  which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and  the innocent victims of crime without justice.  
1982_59	1982_59	We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase  jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air. We're encouraged  by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further  progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.  
1982_61	1982_61	At Ottawa and Cancun, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and  developing nations. Now, some of those I met with were a little surprised  that I didn't apologize for America's wealth. Instead, I spoke of the  strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them  realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom. I  believe lasting friendships were made, and the foundation was laid for  future cooperation.  
1982_64	1982_64	When action is called for, we're taking it. Our sanctions against the  military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in  Poland and against the Soviet regime behind that military  dictatorship clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not  conduct "business as usual" with the forces of oppression. If the events in  Poland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow.  
1982_66	1982_66	Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as  I announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th. We have  proposed to the Soviet Union a far_reaching agenda for mutual reduction of  military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva  on intermediate_range nuclear forces. In those talks it is essential that  we negotiate from a position of strength. There must be a real incentive  for the Soviets to take these talks seriously. This requires that we  rebuild our defenses.  
1982_72	1982_72	We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who  overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago. But  our glory didn't end with them. Americans ever since have emulated their  deeds.  
1982_77	1982_77	Well, that President and that Congress did not fail the American people.  Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union. Let it be said  of us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to bring  America through difficult times. Let us so conduct ourselves that two  centuries from now, another Congress and another President, meeting in this  Chamber as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we met  the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of  liberty this last, best hope of man on Earth.  
1982_79	1982_79	NOTE: The President spoke at 9 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol.  He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of  Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio  and television.  
1983_2	1983_2	This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the United  States has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington first  did so in 1790. That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new  things to say about the State of the Union. The very key to our success has  been our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our lasting values by  making change work for us rather than against us.  
1983_4	1983_4	As we gather here tonight, the state of our Union is strong, but our  economy is troubled. For too many of our fellow citizens farmers, steel and  auto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers this is a painful  period. We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an  end. It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that was a long time  in the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a  better future for ourselves and our children.  
1983_10	1983_10	There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken  together it performs a package that all of us can support. It asks for some  sacrifice by all the self_employed, beneficiaries, workers, government  employees, and the better_off among the retired but it imposes an undue  burden on none. And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the  American people: The integrity of the social security system will be  preserved, and no one's payments will be reduced.  
1983_11	1983_11	The Commission's plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job. We owe  it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers. So, before we go  any further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the  Commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and  Speaker Tip O'Neill for a job well done. I hope and pray the bipartisan  spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face  the challenges of the year ahead.  
1983_15	1983_15	The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of  government had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and out  of government had predicted. Curing those problems has taken more time and  a higher toll than any of us wanted. Unemployment is far too high.  Projected Federal spending if government refuses to tighten its own  belt will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic  recovery now underway.  
1983_16	1983_16	This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and  spending for consumer items and capital goods the stimulus we need to  restart our stalled economic engines. The American people have already  stepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to  modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to  business and industry.  
1983_18	1983_18	So, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital  industries like housing and autos.  
1983_22	1983_22	The Federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.  Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could  face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future.  Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion  dollars more in national debt in the next 4 years alone. That would average  $4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child, and baby in our  nation.  
1983_23	1983_23	To assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending  under control to bring those deficits down. If we don't, the recovery will  be too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we will leave an  unconscionable burden of national debt for our children. That we must not  do.  
1983_24	1983_24	Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from. Contrary to the  drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face  are not rooted in defense spending. Taken as a percentage of the gross  national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four_fifths  of what it was in 1970. Nor is the deficit, as some would have it, rooted  in tax cuts. Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national  product remain about the same as they were in 1970. The fact is, our  deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic  spending.  
1983_31	1983_31	Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing  $55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years. These are savings  recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they can  be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms  reductions or endanger America's security. We will not gamble with our  national survival.  
1983_34	1983_34	At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax  reforms that we've already enacted, including the 10_percent tax break  coming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will protect all  Americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead.  
1983_40	1983_40	Education, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as are  research and development and productivity. Labor, management, and  government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools  of growth. Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government programs all  need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness. Every American  has a role and a stake in international trade.  
1983_49	1983_49	I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will  continue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their roles  as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.  
1983_52	1983_52	To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics,  and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as  mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when  that first Model T rattled down Main Street, U.S.A. But as surely as  America's pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century,  the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of  opportunity, the frontier of high technology.  
1983_61	1983_61	In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in  ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the  PLO from Beirut.  
1983_71	1983_71	Right now we need both realism and idealism. Millions of our neighbors are  without work. It is up to us to see they aren't without hope. This is a  task for all of us. And may I say, Americans have rallied to this cause,  proving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth.  
1983_75	1983_75	We who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making it  absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that, together,  we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth.  
1983_80	1983_80	From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at new  construction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors are  helping neighbors. And they've already begun the building, the research,  the work, and the giving that will make our country great again.  
1983_84	1983_84	NOTE: The President spoke at 9:03 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.  He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of  Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio  and television.  
1984_3	1984_3	You and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past. But  they didn't keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a  long decline that had drained this nation's spirit and eroded its health.  There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land. America is back,  standing tall, looking to the eighties with courage, confidence, and hope.  
1984_7	1984_7	Americans were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done it.  We're confronting our problems one by one. Hope is alive tonight for  millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax  increases and crushing inflation. Inflation has been beaten down from 12.4  to 3.2 percent, and that's a great victory for all the people. The prime  rate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to bring it  down even more.  
1984_8	1984_8	Together, we passed the first across_the_board tax reduction for everyone  since the Kennedy tax cuts. Next year, tax rates will be indexed so  inflation can't push people into higher brackets when they get  cost_of_living pay raises. Government must never again use inflation to  profit at the people's expense.  
1984_11	1984_11	People like these are heroes for the eighties. They helped 4 million  Americans find jobs in 1983. More people are drawing paychecks tonight than  ever before. And Congress helps or progress helps everyone well, Congress  does too  everyone. In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobs  in managerial, professional, and technical fields.  
1984_18	1984_18	We can ensure steady economic growth. We can develop America's next  frontier. We can strengthen our traditional values. And we can build a  meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith  that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom,  progress, and hope.  
1984_25	1984_25	The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control. But  the basis for such spending had been laid in previous years. A pattern of  overspending has been in place for half a century. As the national debt  grew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to ourselves.  
1984_26	1984_26	Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry. But there's a difference  of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending cut, or some  of both. Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit  could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business  and industrial expansion. Well, I think that debate is missing an important  point. Whether government borrows or increases taxes, it will be taking the  same amount of money from the private sector, and, either way, that's too  much. Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on  families struggling to pay their bills. The root of the problem is that  government's share is more than we can afford if we're to have a sound  economy.  
1984_27	1984_27	We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth. In the  budget that I will submit on February 1st, I will recommend measures that  will reduce the deficit over the next 5 years. Many of these will be  unfinished business from last year's budget.  
1984_35	1984_35	There's a better way. Let us go forward with an historic reform for  fairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth. I am asking Secretary Don  Regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all  taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly. And I believe such a  plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the  sunlight of honest tax compliance. And it could make the tax base broader,  so personal tax rates could come down, not go up. I've asked that specific  recommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me by  December 1984.  
1984_43	1984_43	Though this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for EPA one  of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency. We will begin the  long, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a  special national resource the Chesapeake Bay.  
1984_47	1984_47	But our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are the  minds and hearts of our people, especially our children. We can help them  build tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values. This must  be our third great goal. For us, faith, work, family, neighborhood,  freedom, and peace are not just words; they're expressions of what America  means, definitions of what makes us a good and loving people.  
1984_51	1984_51	And while I'm on this subject, each day your Members observe a 200_year_old  tradition meant to signify America is one nation under God. I must ask: If  you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here  leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed  again by children in every schoolroom across this land?  
1984_53	1984_53	During our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore  protection of the law to unborn children. Now, I know this issue is very  controversial. But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child  is not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that it  isn't? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is to  the contrary. We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and if  Americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping,  then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion.  
1984_56	1984_56	Opportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fair  housing and work to ensure women's rights, provide for equitable treatment  in pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts, facilitate child  care, and enforce delinquent parent support payments.  
1984_57	1984_57	It's not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our  values and shape our future. So, I ask your help in assisting more  communities to break the bondage of dependency. Help us to free enterprise  by permitting debate and voting "yes" on our proposal for enterprise zones  in America. This has been before you for 2 years. Its passage can help  high_unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods.  
1984_60	1984_60	We have no territorial ambitions. We occupy no countries. We build no walls  to lock people in. Americans build the future. And our vision of a better  life for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the Americas to Asia,  begins with a simple premise: The future is best decided by ballots, not  bullets.  
1984_64	1984_64	The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the  Scowcroft commission, which strengthened our ability to deter war and  protect peace. In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with the  Henry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan  Commission on Central America.  
1984_70	1984_70	People of the Soviet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who fought by your side  in World War II, said the essential struggle "is not merely man against man  or nation against nation. It is man against war." Americans are people of  peace. If your government wants peace, there will be peace. We can come  together in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for  our children and our children's children. And the whole world will rejoice.  That is my message to you.  
1984_71	1984_71	Some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or  a friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to be  Americans.  
1984_74	1984_74	And then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and civic  volunteers. Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and  community problems. They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds, calm our  fears, and share our joy.  
1984_75	1984_75	A person like Father Ritter is always there. His Covenant House programs in  New York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened  and abused children each year. The same is true of Dr. Charles Carson.  Paralyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is impossible. Today  in Minnesota, he works 80 hours a week without pay, helping pioneer the  field of computer_controlled walking. He has given hope to 500,000  paralyzed Americans that some day they may walk again.  
1984_78	1984_78	I've never felt more strongly that America's best days and democracy's best  days lie ahead. We're a powerful force for good. With faith and courage, we  can perform great deeds and take freedom's next step. And we will. We will  carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light  where there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where there  was disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was only  bloodshed.  
1984_80	1984_80	Thank you very much. God bless you, and God bless America.  
1984_81	1984_81	NOTE: The President spoke at 9:02 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.  He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of  Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and  television.  
1985_2	1985_2	I come before you to report on the state of our Union, and I'm pleased to  report that after 4 years of united effort, the American people have  brought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure than  before.  
1985_3	1985_3	Four years ago we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions about  government and its place in our lives. Out of that change has come great  and robust growth in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the  world.  
1985_8	1985_8	For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if (as) the  family goes, so goes our civilization;  
1985_11	1985_11	For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for  help.  
1985_16	1985_16	Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom. There are no  constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no  barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect. Already, pushing  down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth.  
1985_19	1985_19	New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut  diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reduce  hospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human  lives.  
1985_25	1985_25	To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we  will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally  exempt from Federal income tax. To restore fairness to families, we will  propose increasing significantly the personal exemption.  
1985_43	1985_43	We're moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and  improve government's management practices. In the long run, we must protect  the taxpayers from government. And I ask again that you pass, as 32 States  have now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend no  more than it takes in. And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43  Governors, to veto individual items in appropriation bills. Senator  Mattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2_year trial run of the  line_item veto. I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk.  
1985_44	1985_44	Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a  time of reckoning. Ours is but a moment in history. But one moment of  courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history  forever.  
1985_50	1985_50	In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving  medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth. We can make crystals of  exceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies,  and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.  
1985_54	1985_54	From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production  in Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools,  and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, we  have refound our values. Private sector initiatives are crucial to our  future.  
1985_55	1985_55	I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious  groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups  enjoy. But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child  stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer. We ask you again, give  children back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this  country.  
1985_56	1985_56	The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking of  a human life or it isn't. And if it is and medical technology is  increasingly showing it is it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony that  while some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry  out for children to adopt. We have room for these children. We can fill the  cradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I ask you in the  Congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.  
1985_57	1985_57	In the area of education, we're returning to excellence, and again, the  heroes are our people, not government. We're stressing basics of  discipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become  computer_smart as well. For 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of our  high school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3  years. We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving  parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for  hard work and achievement through merit pay.  
1985_60	1985_60	But we must do more. I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact  proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers  acquire in good faith. These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus  laws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of  Americans, the use of the death penalty where necessary.  
1985_62	1985_62	Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy,  we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world.  Our alliances are stronger than ever. Our economy is stronger than ever. We  have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world. And all of  these together are a great force for peace.  
1985_63	1985_63	Since 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms  agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear  arsenals. Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced  the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table. Our negotiators must be  able to go to that table with the united support of the American people.  All of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons  are banned from this Earth forever.  
1985_64	1985_64	Each Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses,  thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement. Your vote this  spring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to  maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms  reductions.  
1985_67	1985_67	Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's hopes  for peace and human progress "lie not in measures of defense or in the  control of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and  self_government."  
1985_68	1985_68	And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedom  is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of  all God's children. Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today. It  is in homes that freedom built. Victories against poverty are greatest and  peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free  speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth.  
1985_69	1985_69	Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to  communicate these ideals everywhere we can. America's economic success is  freedom's success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred  different nations. Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few  resources other than the enterprise of their own people. But through low  tax rates and free markets they've soared ahead of centralized economies.  And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.  
1985_72	1985_72	We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can we  be passive when freedom is under siege. Without resources, diplomacy cannot  succeed. Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend  themselves and give them confidence to work for peace. And I hope that you  in the Congress will understand that, dollar for dollar, security  assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense  budget.  
1985_74	1985_74	The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban_Soviet bloc  support, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free  press, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attacking  neighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self_defense and  totally consistent with the OAS and U.N. Charters. It is essential that the  Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America. I want  to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to  our own security.  
1985_80	1985_80	NOTE: The President spoke at 9:05 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.  He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of  Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio  and television.  
1986_4	1986_4	I have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of  unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. I am pleased to  report the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growing  stronger each day. Tonight we look out on a rising America, firm of heart,  united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism. America is on the move!  But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land: locked  factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and interest rates  turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams.  Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant,  slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots  of our freedom. What brought America back? The American people brought us  back with quiet courage and common sense, with undying faith that in this  nation under God the future will be ours; for the future belongs to the  free.  
1986_5	1986_5	Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of  economic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9  million new jobs in 3 years, interest rates cut in half, inflation falling  over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today, and a mighty river of good  works a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone. And  despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the  moral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for the  future. Family and community are the costars of this great American  comeback. They are why we say tonight: Private values must be at the heart  of public policies.  
1986_9	1986_9	Members of Congress, passage of Gramm_Rudman_Hollings gives us an historic  opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades:  forcing the Federal Government to live within its means. Your schedule now  requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th, the very day  America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce.  How often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from  paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes  and bills. And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised. Well, I'm  sorry; they're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts. It's time we  reduce the Federal budget and left the family budget alone. We do not face  large deficits because American families are undertaxed; we face those  deficits because the Federal Government overspends.  
1986_12	1986_12	I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. We must  meet it. Defense is not just another budget expense. Keeping America  strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the Federal  Government; it is government's prime responsibility. We have devoted 5  years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect, and  we've made important gains. Yet the threat from Soviet forces, conventional  and strategic, from the Soviet drive for domination, from the increase in  espionage and state terror remains great. This is reality. Closing our eyes  will not make reality disappear. We pledged together to hold real growth in  defense spending to the bare minimum. My budget honors that pledge, and I'm  now asking you, the Congress, to keep its end of the bargain. The Soviets  must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a  reduced threat, not a reduced resolve.  
1986_19	1986_19	As we work to make the American dream real for all, we must also look to  the condition of America's families. Struggling parents today worry how  they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave  them. In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic  support system, has reached crisis proportions in female and child  poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools.  After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of  the poor grows more painful. But the waste in dollars and cents pales  before the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human spirit and  potential. We can ignore this terrible truth no longer. As Franklin  Roosevelt warned 51 years ago, standing before this Chamber, he said,  "Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit." And we  must now escape the spider's web of dependency.  
1986_22	1986_22	Well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of  subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. Astronomers  build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and  possibly back to the moment of creation. So, yes, this nation remains fully  committed to America's space program. We're going forward with our shuttle  flights. We're going forward to build our space station. And we are going  forward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the  next decade, take off from Dulles Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the  speed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within 2  hours. And the same technology transforming our lives can solve the  greatest problem of the 20th century. A security shield can one day render  nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear  terror. America met one historic challenge and went to the Moon. Now  America must meet another: to make our strategic defense real for all the  citizens of planet Earth.  
1986_26	1986_26	Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the  security of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, than  to achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua's democratic  neighbors. This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what  must be done for that great and good cause. As (former Senator Henry  M.)Scoop Jackson, the inspiration for our Bipartisan Commission on Central  America, once said, "In matters of national security, the best politics is  no politics."  
1986_27	1986_27	What we accomplish this year, in each challenge we face, will set our  course for the balance of the decade, indeed, for the remainder of the  century. After all we've done so far, let no one say that this nation  cannot reach the destiny of our dreams. America believes, America is ready,  America can win the race to the future and we shall. The American dream is  a song of hope that rings through night winter air; vivid, tender music  that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest  things: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new beauty in music,  literature, and art; to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip  or a single human cell.  
1986_29	1986_29	We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12_year_old, Tyrone Ford.  A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to  become an accomplished pianist and singer. He also directs the choirs of  three churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center. With God as your  composer, Tyrone, your music will be the music of angels.  
1986_30	1986_30	We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13_year_old Shelby  Butler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol. Seeing  another girl freeze in terror before an out_of_control school bus, she  risked her life and pulled her to safety. With bravery like yours, Shelby,  America need never fear for our future.  
1986_35	1986_35	NOTE: The President spoke at 8:04 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.  He was introduced by Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., Speaker of the House of  Representatives. The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio  and television.  
1987_8	1987_8	Since 1970 the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military  forces than we have. Even today, though nearly 1 in 3 Soviet families is  without running hot water and the average family spends 2 hours a day  shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found  the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the  past 5 years clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia,  Afghanistan, and Nicaragua. With 120,000 Soviet combat and military  personnel and 15,000 military advisers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,  can anyone still doubt their single_minded determination to expand their  power? Despite this, the Congress cut my request for critical U.S. security  assistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defense  requests by $85 billion in the last 3 years.  
1987_9	1987_9	These assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual  interests. And when the programs are devastated, American interests are  harmed. My friends, it's my duty as President to say to you again tonight  that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve. Today  the brave people of Afghanistan are showing that resolve. The Soviet Union  says it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet it continues a  brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. We are  ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal  of all Soviet troops and genuine self_determination for the Afghan people.  
1987_11	1987_11	Our commitment to a Western Hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur  by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. It began with the  Monroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan American  policy. Franklin Roosevelt said we "are determined to do everything  possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere." President Truman was very  blunt: "International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy  the independence of the Americas. We cannot let that happen here." And John  F. Kennedy made clear that "Communist domination in this hemisphere can  never be negotiated." Some in this Congress may choose to depart from this  historic commitment, but I will not.  
1987_17	1987_17	Next, the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing of deadlines and  the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of  billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. We ask the  Congress once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have a  lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork, those items  that would never survive on their own. I will send the Congress broad  recommendations on the budget, but first I'd like to see yours. Let's go to  work and get this done together.  
1987_19	1987_19	Now, next month I'll place two additional reforms before the Congress.  We've created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense  of priorities. Our national welfare system consists of some 59 major  programs and over 6,000 pages of Federal laws and regulations on which more  than $132 billion was spent in 1985. I will propose a new national welfare  strategy, a program of welfare reform through State_sponsored,  community_based demonstration projects. This is the time to reform this  outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap. Now, we will  never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help.  But let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare  and made self_supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients  want more than anything else. Next, let us remove a financial specter  facing our older Americans: the fear of an illness so expensive that it can  result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and  death. I will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the  fear of catastrophic illness.  
1987_21	1987_21	Preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children. We need  to set for them new and more rigorous goals. We must demand more of  ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the  year 2000. Our children should master the basic concepts of math and  science, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they  have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage.  There's one more thing we can't let up on: Let's redouble our personal  efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug_free learning  environment. If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we  will defeat that scourge all over the country.  
1987_24	1987_24	Over the next few weeks, I'll be sending the Congress a complete series of  these special messages on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness,  including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture,  and other subjects. The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these  tools work, it really comes down to just being our best. And that is the  core of American greatness. The responsibility of freedom presses us  towards higher knowledge and, I believe, moral and spiritual greatness.  Through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of  freeing people's spirits. But only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar  against our own individual standards. Excellence is what makes freedom  ring. And isn't that what we do best?  
1987_28	1987_28	Just three words: We the people those are the kids on Christmas Day  looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea or  aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. A million miles from home,  but doing their duty.  
1987_29	1987_29	We the people those are the warmhearted whose numbers we can't begin to  count, who'll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will  never know and MIA families they will never meet. Why? Because that's the  way we are, this unique breed we call Americans.  
1987_30	1987_30	We the people they're farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a  hungry world. They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their  tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because  of a mother who used drugs. And you'll forgive me a special memory it's a  million mothers like Nelle Reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a  hungry person away from her kitchen door.  
1987_33	1987_33	Well, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around  Franklin leaning in to listen more closely to him. And then Dr. Franklin  began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their  efforts, and this is what he said: "I have often looked at that picture  behind the President without being able to tell whether it was a rising or  setting Sun: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a  rising and not a setting Sun." Well, you can bet it's rising because, my  fellow citizens, America isn't finished. Her best days have just begun.  
1988_1	1988_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the House and  Senate: When we first met here 7 years ago many of us for the first  time it was with the hope of beginning something new for America. We meet  here tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work. If anyone  expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my  administration, I say let's leave that to history; we're not finished yet.  So, my message to you tonight is put on your work shoes; we're still on the  job.  
1988_3	1988_3	All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr. Gorbachev was  here the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind  began with three simple words: "We the People," the revolutionary notion  that the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around.  And there's one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I would  offer to you now. Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each  other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too,  America's leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep  foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our  party but what is best for America.  
1988_4	1988_4	In the spirit of Jefferson, let us affirm that in this Chamber tonight  there are no Republicans, no Democrats just Americans. Yes, we will have  our differences, but let us always remember what unites us far outweighs  whatever divides us. Those who sent us here to serve them the millions of  Americans watching and listening tonight expect this of us. Let's prove to  them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year. We've  done this before. And as we have worked together to bring down spending,  tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America  has created more jobs and better, higher paying jobs; family income has  risen for 4 straight years, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at  the fastest rate in more than 10 years.  
1988_6	1988_6	In international relations, too, there's only one description for what,  together, we have achieved: a complete turnabout, a revolution. Seven years  ago, America was weak, and freedom everywhere was under siege. Today  America is strong, and democracy is everywhere on the move. From Central  America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and  human rights are taking hold. We've replaced "Blame America" with "Look up  to America." We've rebuilt our defenses. And of all our accomplishments,  none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are  again proud to wear our country's uniform.  
1988_7	1988_7	And in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three developments arms  reduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic  revolution that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have  dared imagine 7 years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great  nightmares of the postwar era. I speak of the startling hope of giving our  children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.  
1988_9	1988_9	Toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. First, steps we can  take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children  a future of low inflation and full employment. Second, let's check our  progress in attacking social problems, where important gains have been  made, but which still need critical attention. I mean schools that work,  economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and  family values. Our third objective tonight is global: continuing the  exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.  Fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade  and a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world  freedom. We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next  President inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that  President: a national security that is unassailable and a national defense  that takes full advantage of new technology and is fully funded.  
1988_11	1988_11	One other thing we Americans like the future like the sound of it, the  idea of it, the hope of it. Where others fear trade and economic growth, we  see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed_of opportunities  for millions in our own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw up  barriers, we seek to bring them down. Where others take counsel of their  fears, we follow our hopes. Yes, we Americans like the future and like  making the most of it. Let's do that now.  
1988_15	1988_15	I know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said, because you  suffered so directly. But let's recall that in 7 years, of 91  appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only  10 made it on time. Last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by  October 1st, none of them made it. Instead, we had four continuing  resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and 2 days, and 3 days,  respectively.  
1988_18	1988_18	I'm also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of  prosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not get to  use it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must have. Give the  President the same authority that 43 Governors use in their States: the  right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and  enforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line_item veto.  
1988_28	1988_28	Well, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to  confront. Tonight, I call America a good nation, a moral people to  charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on  demand. To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her  own body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child  is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation  that would stop all Federal funding for abortion and with a human life  amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens  the life of the mother. Our Judeo_Christian tradition recognizes the right  of taking a life in self_defense. But with that one exception, let us look  to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. I pledge to  you tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full  sharing in family life to millions of Americans so that children who need  homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them.  
1988_29	1988_29	And let me add here: So many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us  that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation's health and vigor.  The Congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the Supreme Court,  with an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being. Yet we are denied the right to  set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray. I  believe Congress should pass our school prayer amendment.  
1988_35	1988_35	This movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is  indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and  against totalitarian rule. This global democratic revolution has removed  the specter, so frightening a decade ago, of democracy doomed to permanent  minority status in the world. In South and Central America, only a third of  the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976. Today over 90 percent of Latin  Americans live in nations committed to democratic principles. And the  resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every  continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny.  
1988_39	1988_39	Yet even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace  and reduce the danger of nuclear war. But let's have no illusions. Three  years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have  increased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing  earlier hard_won goals. We must face squarely the implications of this  negative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both  this year and in the future.  
1988_42	1988_42	As I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we  never had a future free of nuclear terror. Reduction of strategic  offensive arms is one step, SDI another. Our funding request for our  Strategic Defense Initiative is less than 2 percent of the total defense  budget. SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent. SDI  has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction. It  reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind.  Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more  stable basis for deterrence. We must also remember that SDI is our  insurance policy against a nuclear accident, a Chernobyl of the sky, or an  accidental launch or some madman who might come along.  
1988_44	1988_44	But my thoughts tonight go beyond this, and I hope you'll let me end this  evening with a personal reflection. You know, the world could never be  quite the same again after Jacob Shallus, a trustworthy and dependable  clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and engrossed  those words about representative government in the preamble of our  Constitution. And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was  forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike in an  obscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke of our duty to  government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the  Earth.  
1988_47	1988_47	We can be proud that for them and for us, as those lights along the Potomac  are still seen this night signaling as they have for nearly two centuries  and as we pray God they always will, that another generation of Americans  has protected and passed on lovingly this place called America, this  shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people.  
1990_1	1990_1	Tonight, I come not to speak about the "State of the Government", not to  detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every  line in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people  about the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the  challenges we face. And what that means for America.  
1990_6	1990_6	"Operation Just Cause" has achieved its objective. And the number of  military personel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the  operation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of  February the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women  of our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.  
1990_8	1990_8	And a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a  prisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of  Czechoslovakia.  
1990_10	1990_10	Remarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long_held  hopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals  of American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the  cause of freedom.  
1990_14	1990_14	And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system  second to none, and make it better:  
1990_15	1990_15	A better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;  
1990_17	1990_17	Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy.  
1990_19	1990_19	And where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work  and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American  mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.  
1990_20	1990_20	Where everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the  help they need to live in dignity.  
1990_21	1990_21	Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and  every one of them makes the grade,  
1990_23	1990_23	And finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out  to our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our  efforts. That's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make  for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our  horizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts  today.  
1990_24	1990_24	In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great  challenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the  global economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make  some fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.  
1990_25	1990_25	Yes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined  to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical  capital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and  production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods  and quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of  ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of course human capital: the  talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.  
1990_26	1990_26	And let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of  American ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker,  that would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the  world.  
1990_30	1990_30	And one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the  governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are  ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've  made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an  extra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head  Start.  
1990_31	1990_31	Education is the one investment that means more for our future, because it  means the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not  simply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting  more, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of  ourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing  America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from  the nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased  that Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor  Campbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these  deliberations, are with us here tonight.  
1990_34	1990_34	Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at  stake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in  education.  
1990_35	1990_35	These investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about  the American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our  energy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against  anyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America  is ready.  
1990_36	1990_36	Since we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet  our challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real  progress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross  national product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the  deficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.  
1990_38	1990_38	And let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For  most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.  
1990_43	1990_43	And something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from  our forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for  generations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.  
1990_44	1990_44	And tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the  Congress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work  to do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit  of cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do  the will of the people clean air, child care, the educational excellence  act, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation  policy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act  together.  
1990_45	1990_45	And there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our commitments.  And I'm talking about Social Security.  
1990_48	1990_48	There's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful  consideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way  now. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan,  Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council  review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our  nation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs  of health care under control.  
1990_51	1990_51	Every effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give  democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.  
1990_52	1990_52	And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as  we live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound  and strong.  
1990_53	1990_53	And to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen  to parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James  Markwell, a 20_year_old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers.  It's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in  Panama. It's a letter servicemen write and hope will never, ever be sent.  And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it  on to me out there in Cincinnati.  
1990_59	1990_59	And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new  consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want  to see.  
1990_63	1990_63	It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to  endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward  democracy and economic opportunity.  
1990_64	1990_64	We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great  uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is  diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.  And, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and  the Strategic Defense Initiative.  
1990_70	1990_70	And here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and  history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood  at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen  workers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall  crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient  symbol of hope.  
1990_71	1990_71	The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of  change, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart  of the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one  of us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.  
1990_72	1990_72	In the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed  once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th  grandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at  home and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.  
1990_74	1990_74	Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year  across this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to  Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding  young environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the  Florida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland,  ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill  or alone and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and  AIDS coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know,  when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of  dreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very  future of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking  about.  
1990_77	1990_77	And to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our  hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your  vision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the  destiny that is yours and yours alone.  
1990_78	1990_78	And finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the  symbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call  America. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each  and every one of us.  
1991_1	1991_1	Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress.  
1991_2	1991_2	I come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans,  certain we stand at a defining hour.  
1991_5	1991_5	What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea a new  world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to  achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom,  and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of  our children's future.  
1991_6	1991_6	The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel  lawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion his ruthless,  systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor violated everything the community  of nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression would not stand,  and it will not stand.  
1991_10	1991_10	We will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain our  contact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to  democratization and reform.  
1991_23	1991_23	The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them  remains the same: it is the individual the individual who steps forward.  And the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other:  the sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities.  
1991_26	1991_26	Since the birth of our nation, "we the people" has been the source of our  strength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the  American people knows no limits.  
1991_27	1991_27	We are a nation of rock_solid realism and clear_eyed idealism. We are  Americans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the nation  that can shape the future.  
1991_30	1991_30	The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people and  their communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our  most precious resource our citizens. We must return to families,  communities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind, the  power to chart their own destiny, and the freedom and opportunity provided  by strong economic growth. That's what America is all about.  
1991_35	1991_35	So let's put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we've  created almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest  rates in half.  
1991_37	1991_37	We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will get  on our way to a new record of expansion, and achieve the competitive  strength that will carry us into the next American century.  
1991_38	1991_38	We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing  in the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual.  
1991_42	1991_42	I know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a  capital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional leaders  and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman  Alan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid  a return to unproductive partisan bickering.  
1991_43	1991_43	But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future,  they must also be matched by long_term investments for the next American  century.  
1991_47	1991_47	Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one of  us has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hate. We  will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once  again press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment  discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences.  
1991_52	1991_52	That would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the  hands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly into the hands  of the individual, it should be moved closer to the people away from  Washington.  
1991_60	1991_60	There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom,  than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and coastguardsman   every man and every woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.  
1991_61	1991_61	Each of them has volunteered to provide for this nation's defense. And now  they bravely struggle to earn for America and for the world and for future  generations, a just and lasting peace.  
1991_63	1991_63	The war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war.  For more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European  Community and the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N.  Secretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand, Ozal,  Mubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and  Andreotti just to name a few all worked for a solution. But time and  again Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace.  
1991_64	1991_64	The world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on August  2nd, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor. And I am  certain of how it will end. So that peace can prevail, we will prevail.  
1991_66	1991_66	Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out from  Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to insure the  stability and security of this critical region.  
1991_69	1991_69	They know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources does  not fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They know that  we need to build a new, enduring peace based not on arms races and  confrontation, but on shared principles and the rule of law.  
1991_70	1991_70	And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in  the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.  
1991_77	1991_77	I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial  burden of this struggle. Last year, our friends and allies provided the  bulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and having now received  commitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am  confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.  
1991_80	1991_80	The world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long_held  promise of a new world order where brutality will go unrewarded, and  aggression will meet collective resistance.  
1991_89	1991_89	May God bless the United States of America.  
1992_1	1992_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored  guests and fellow citizens:  
1992_2	1992_2	I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they  hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move  our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.  
1992_6	1992_6	A year ago tonight I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American  forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the  desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America's armed  forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared, and that you  endorsed: we liberated Kuwait.  
1992_8	1992_8	Much good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come  from this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one  sole and pre_eminent power, the United States of America. And this they  regard with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is  right. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be on the  side of decency. They trust us to do what's right.  
1992_9	1992_9	I use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a  telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the  gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me  to know that some day, when her children were old enough, she would tell  them "that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to  do". She said it all. It was the right thing to do.  
1992_15	1992_15	The Secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the  joint chiefs of staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not  misunderstand me: The reductions I have approved will save us an additional  $50 billion over the next five years. By 1997 we will have cut defense by  30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my  resolve: this deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to  progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back  to the days of "the hollow army". We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice  in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was  purged as if the world was permanently safe.  
1992_16	1992_16	I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a  program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must  have this protection because too many people in too many countries have  access to nuclear arms. There are those who say that now we can turn away  from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are  the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the  leader of the world.  
1992_17	1992_17	As long as I am President we will continue to lead in support of freedom  everywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the  safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the  pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no  virtue.  
1992_18	1992_18	Now to our troubles at home. They are not all economic, but the primary  problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief,  is down, and interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some  industries are in trouble and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell  you right from the start and right from the heart: I know we're in hard  times, but I know something else: This will not stand.  
1992_21	1992_21	We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest  money and make new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear  away obstacles to new growth: high taxes, high regulation, red tape, and  yes, wasteful government spending. None of this will happen with a snap of  the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn't whether it's  called new or dazzling. The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks.  They're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of  a plan is, It is sound and will it work? We must have a short_term plan to  address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a  long_term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in  the world economy.  
1992_27	1992_27	And finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to  people who own a home, to every one who has a business, a farm or a single  investment.  
1992_32	1992_32	And I submit my plan tomorrow. And I am asking you to pass it by March 20.  From the day after that if it must be the battle is joined. And you  know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.  
1992_37	1992_37	And fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. And it is time for  a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. Its saps our  strength and hurts our faith in our society, and in our future together.  Surely a tired woman on her way to work at six in the morning on a subway  deserves the right to get there safely. And surely, it's true that everyone  who changes his or her way of life because of crime from those afraid to  go our at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for surely  those people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore  it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals  and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed  halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country.  
1992_40	1992_40	Now some pretend we can have it both ways: they call it play or pay. But  that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs,  and eventually, a system under complete government control. Really, there  are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a  system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the  government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we'll get is patients  in long lines, indifferent service and a huge new tax burden. Or we can  reform our own private health_care system, which still gives us, for all  its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. Well, let's build on  our strengths.  
1992_44	1992_44	We must put an end to unfinanced government mandates. These are the  requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without  supplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced  to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a  mandate just increases someone else's tax burden, and that means higher  taxes at the state and local level.  
1992_50	1992_50	States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new  assumptions: that when able_bodied people receive government assistance  they have responsibilities to the taxpayer. A responsibility to seek work,  education, or job training. A responsibility to get their lives in order. A  responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having  children out of wedlock. And a responsibility to obey the law. We are going  to help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving certain federal  regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every  state that asks our help. And I want to add, as we make these changes, we  work together to improve this system, that our intention is not  scapegoating and finger_pointing. If you read the papers or watch TV you  know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist  comments, anti_Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is  not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable.  
1992_53	1992_53	And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailyness of our  lives, we forget. We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the  kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always  risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this nation out of hard  times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us better step  aside. Because I look at hard times and I make this vow: This will not  stand. And so we move on, together, a rising nation, the once and future  miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world.  
1994_1	1994_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of the 103rd Congress, my fellow  Americans:  
1994_2	1994_2	I am not sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight, but I hope we can  talk about the State of the Union.  
1994_3	1994_3	I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over  this chamber with such force and grace. Tip O'Neill liked to call himself  "A Man of the House" and he surely was that. But even more, he was a man of  the people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American  middle class. Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or  who sent him here. Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from  the Lord's gallery. But in his honor, may we too also remember who we are,  where we come from, and who sent us here.  
1994_5	1994_5	We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all  nations are tested. Our American heritage has always been to master such  change, to use it to expand opportunity at home, and our leadership abroad.  But for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our  country drifted.  
1994_6	1994_6	For 30 years family life in America has been breaking down. For 20 years  the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. For the 12  years of trickle down economics we built a false prosperity on a hollow  base as our national debt quadrupled. From 1989 to 1992 we experienced the  slowest growth in a half century. For too many families, even when both  parents were working, the American dream has been slipping away.  
1994_11	1994_11	And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, Sarah. This  Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of nine out of 10 small  businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. It  produced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood  immunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable  college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for  those who want to give something back to their country and their  communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high_tech  investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high_tech economy. This  Congress produced a new law the motor voter bill to help millions of  people register to vote. It produced family and medical leave all passed,  all signed into law, with not one single veto.  
1994_13	1994_13	Family And Medical Leave  
1994_15	1994_15	Though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. Many Americans  still haven't felt the impact of what we've done. The recovery still hasn't  touched every community or created enough jobs. Incomes are still stagnant.  There's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places.  
1994_20	1994_20	Led by the vice president, we've launched a campaign to reinvent  government. We've cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal  limousines. After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but  whose actions expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people  over the next five years. By the time we have finished, the federal  bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years.  
1994_24	1994_24	The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early  results proud. But everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge  that there is more to do. Next month I will send you one of the toughest  budgets ever presented to Congress. It will cut spending in more than 300  programs, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reforms the way in which  governments buy goods and services.  
1994_25	1994_25	This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard  spending ceilings we have set. We must do it. We have proved we can bring  the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or  the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. If you  will stick with this plan, we will post three consecutive years of  declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White  House. And once again, the buck stops here.  
1994_28	1994_28	As we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the  technologies of tomorrow. Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily  and create jobs for our people here at home.  
1994_29	1994_29	As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental  technologies of the future which will create jobs. This year we will fight  for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a  reformed Superfund program.  
1994_30	1994_30	And the vice president is right; we must also work with the private sector  to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in  America into a national information superhighway by the year 2000. Think of  it. Instant access to information will increase productivity. It will help  to educate our children. It will provide better medical care. It will  create jobs. And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish  that information superhighway this year.  
1994_34	1994_34	Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to  experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private  corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish  to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our  children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global  economy?  
1994_36	1994_36	Welfare  
1994_38	1994_38	If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child  support absent parents out to be paying to millions of parents who are  taking care of their children . If we value strong families, we can't  perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. Can  you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the  government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a  grandparent? That's not just bad policy, it's wrong and we ought to change  it.  
1994_43	1994_43	People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away  from them.  
1994_48	1994_48	That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth.  
1994_54	1994_54	From the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to  strengthen what is good about our health care system the world's best  health care professionals, cutting edge research, and wonderful research  institutions, Medicare for older Americans. None of this none of it  should be put at risk. But we're paying more and more money for less and  less care. Every year, fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their  doctors. Every year, doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and  less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the  present system has become.  
1994_61	1994_61	To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the  solution to today's squeeze on middle class working people's health care is  not to put the squeeze on middle class retired people's health care. We can  do better than that. When it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me.  Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean. You pay a fair price for  security, and when you get sick, health care is always there no matter  what.  
1994_64	1994_64	I know that facing up to these interests will require courage. It will  raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how  lobbyists yield their influence. The work of change, frankly, will never  get any easier until we limit the influence of well financed interests who  profit from this current system. So I also must now call on you to finish  the job both houses began last year, by passing tough and meaningful  campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.  
1994_65	1994_65	You know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us. The  American people provide those of us in government service with terrific  health care benefits at reasonable costs. We have health care that's always  there. I think we need to give every hard working, taxpaying American the  same health care security they have already given to us.  
1994_68	1994_68	Foreign Policy  
1994_77	1994_77	But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures, and  they must chart their own futures, how much more secure and more prosperous  our own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across  the former communist bloc. Our policy has been to support that move and  that has been the policy of the Congress. We should continue it.  
1994_79	1994_79	That is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European  partners to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a  Europe that has the possibility of becoming unified for the first time in  its entire history, it's entire history, based on the simple commitments of  all nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for  existing borders.  
1994_81	1994_81	This year, we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human  rights and sustainable development all around the world. We will ask  Congress to ratify the new GATT accord, we will continue standing by South  Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult  transition to democracy. We will convene a summit of the Western  hemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America.  And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in  Haiti.  
1994_83	1994_83	Middle East  
1994_84	1994_84	We will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace. Last year  the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat at the White House when  they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. But there is a long,  hard road ahead. And on that road I am determined that I and our  administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting  peace for all the peoples of the region.  
1994_97	1994_97	Fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage  of crimes. Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise  again among our young people. The Crime Bill contains all the crime bills  contain more money for drug treatment, for criminal addicts, and boot  camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and  to stay off drugs. Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains  a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. You must  pass them both. We need then desperately.  
1994_98	1994_98	My fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an un_American problem. It  has no partisan or philosophical element. Therefore, I urge you find ways  as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong,  smart, tough crime bill.  
1994_101	1994_101	The Role Of Government  
1994_103	1994_103	The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going  to bring back work and family and community. We cannot renew our country  when, within a decade, more than half of the children will be born into  families where there has been no marriage. We cannot renew this country  when 13_year_old boys get semi_automatic weapons to shoot 9 year olds for  kicks. We can't renew our country when children are having children and the  fathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything. We can't renew  the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new  customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who'd give  anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had  the money to do it.  
1994_107	1994_107	Oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the  challenges of this time, but they misread our history, our heritage, even  today's headlines. All those things tell us we can and we will overcome any  challenge.  
1994_109	1994_109	Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving  our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting.  
1994_111	1994_111	Tonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old  as the republic itself, what is the state of our union?  
1994_113	1994_113	Thank you and God Bless America.  
1995_6	1995_6	I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard  America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must  say: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us.  For we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in  this new and very demanding era.  
1995_16	1995_16	Our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the  deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give  our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild  their own communities. But the rising tide is not lifting all the boats.  
1995_20	1995_20	More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt  told our nation new conditions impose new requirements on Government and  those who conduct Government. And from that simple proposition he shaped  the New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined  the relationship between our people and their Government for half a  century.  
1995_28	1995_28	My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion.  Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this  course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party  label we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a  simple one: Is it good for the American people?  
1995_30	1995_30	But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work  around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors  of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their  capital and they see a city where the well_connected and the well_protected  can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left  out.  
1995_32	1995_32	Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know  there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something  that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time: There doesn't  have to be a law for everything.  
1995_35	1995_35	And as I have said for three years, we should work to open the air waves so  that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by  giving free TV time to candidates for public office.  
1995_36	1995_36	When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported  in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred  building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to  cheer about.  
1995_41	1995_41	The old way dispensed services through large, top_down, inflexible  bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and  decision making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and  competition and individual responsibility into national policy.  
1995_47	1995_47	Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can  meet today's and tomorrow's needs.  
1995_48	1995_48	And we ought to do it together.  
1995_50	1995_50	We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in  spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from  the Federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone.  
1995_51	1995_51	Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a  quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the  smallest it has been since John Kennedy was president, by the time I come  here again next year.  
1995_52	1995_52	Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already  saved taxpayers $ 63 billion. The age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray  you can break on David Letterman is gone. Deadwood programs like mohair  subsidies are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by  reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small_business  loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the  Government's 10,000_page personnel manual.  
1995_54	1995_54	You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or  the people in California who've dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires  and they'll tell you that.  
1995_55	1995_55	Government workers, working hand_in_hand with private business, rebuilt  Southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget.  
1995_56	1995_56	And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600  schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.  
1995_58	1995_58	University administrators all over the country have told me that they are  saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct  college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable  with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less and  cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the  universities.  
1995_63	1995_63	And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We  need to help move programs down to the point where states and communities  and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can  do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let  them do what they can do better.  
1995_69	1995_69	But, I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that  Government still has important responsibilities.  
1995_70	1995_70	Our young people we should think of this when we cut our young people  hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And  our senior citizens have made us what we are.  
1995_74	1995_74	Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools,  Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants all  these things are in the national interest.  
1995_79	1995_79	And we should be doing things in the open around here. For example,  everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social  Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.  
1995_80	1995_80	Welfare  
1995_84	1995_84	Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever  presented by an Administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant  to be a second chance, not a way of life.  
1995_90	1995_90	And I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about  this for a long time: I still don't think we can, in good conscience,  punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.  
1995_91	1995_91	My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people  care about this, without regard to party or race or region. So let this be  the year we end welfare as we know it.  
1995_92	1995_92	But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue  to divide America.  
1995_98	1995_98	I know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all  the citizens of our country. But I remind you that last year we passed a  very tough crime bill longer sentences, three strikes and you're out,  almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention,  100,000 more police and we paid for it all by reducing the size of the  Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower  the crime rate.  
1995_100	1995_100	Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the  crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it and  if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate, and I am  convinced that it does, let us not go back on it, let's stick with it,  implement it we've got four more hard years of work to do to do that.  
1995_104	1995_104	But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police  officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of  assault_weapon attacks, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let  it be repealed.  
1995_105	1995_105	I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I  want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs  that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility and are  organized from the grass roots up, not by Federal bureaucracy.  
1995_108	1995_108	Illegal Immigration  
1995_112	1995_112	We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is  wrong and ultimately self_defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit  the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and  we must do more to stop it.  
1995_114	1995_114	America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost six  million new jobs in the last two years, exports booming, inflation down,  high_wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs  are living the American dream.  
1995_116	1995_116	Today, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder  for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they  can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement  for themselves.  
1995_118	1995_118	We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this  new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and  every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew  our skills.  
1995_119	1995_119	Education  
1995_120	1995_120	That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the  last two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for  young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more  available and more affordable.  
1995_122	1995_122	Taxes  
1995_124	1995_124	We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million  families with incomes under $ 27,000, a tax cut that this year will average  about $ 1,000 a family.  
1995_125	1995_125	And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we  could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we  inherited and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both, and  now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.  
1995_128	1995_128	I have proposed a middle_class bill of rights, which should properly be  called the bill of rights and responsibilities, because its provisions only  benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to  educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise  incomes, in both the short run and the long run, in a way that benefits all  of us.  
1995_129	1995_129	There are four provisions:  
1995_134	1995_134	Cutting The Deficit Now  
1995_136	1995_136	Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't  return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not  be done: We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion, about $ 10,000 for every  family in this country. It's coming down three years in a row for the first  time since Mr. Truman was President and I don't think anybody in America  wants us to let it explode again.  
1995_139	1995_139	My tests for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes?  Will it strengthen our families and support our children? Is it paid for?  Will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?  
1995_140	1995_140	If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.  
1995_144	1995_144	Now I studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum_wage  increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase  does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But  the most important thing is you can't make a living on $ 4.25 an hour. Now   especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut  we passed last year.  
1995_145	1995_145	In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it  should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on  this, to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living  wage.  
1995_146	1995_146	Members of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the  week 28 days into the new year every member of Congress will have  earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum_wage worker makes all  year long.  
1995_149	1995_149	Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do  anything. And the cold, hard fact is that since last year since I was  here another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their  health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more most of  them farmers and small business people and self_employed people have  seen their premiums skyrocket, their co_pays and deductibles go up.  
1995_150	1995_150	There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have  health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says  they won't lose their home if they get sick.  
1995_156	1995_156	Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've  already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of  America today are entirely internal to our borders, they relate to the  security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our  streets, our health and protecting those borders.  
1995_158	1995_158	Now that the Cold War has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the  security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home.  But it's not so. Our security still depends on our continued world  leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at  home unless we're strong abroad.  
1995_159	1995_159	Mexico  
1995_163	1995_163	Russia  
1995_171	1995_171	Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and  injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I  send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in  the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go  forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and  we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors  in the Middle East.  
1995_174	1995_174	Defense  
1995_176	1995_176	I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became  President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a  very great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in number,  we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and  stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways, and we must  give them and their families what the times demand and what they have  earned.  
1995_177	1995_177	Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing  America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in  Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait,  giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.  
1995_178	1995_178	We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South  Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from  Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those  places but they make our future more confident and more secure.  
1995_184	1995_184	We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart.  And we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The PTA, the town  hall meeting, the ball park it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to  find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust  and cooperation.  
1995_192	1995_192	And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know,  I'm proud of the fact that the United States has more house of worship per  capita than any country in the world. These people, who lead our houses of  worship, can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action,  can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to  those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear, because  so much of what must be done must come from the inside out. And our  religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference. They  have a role in the New Covenant as well.  
1995_193	1995_193	There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it  takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets  and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity  houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of  people to provide the people power for all the civic organizations in this  country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were  kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between  right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to  the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to  be.  
1996_1	1996_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th Congress,  distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land:  
1996_3	1996_3	My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union not the state of  our government, but of our American community; and to set forth our  responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect  union.  
1996_4	1996_4	The state of the Union is strong. Our economy is the healthiest it has been  in three decades. We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and  inflation in 27 years. We have created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a  million of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles.  America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970s.  And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses  started in our country.  
1996_7	1996_7	The Role Of Government  
1996_11	1996_11	I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old_fashioned  American way, together with all of our citizens through state and local  governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic  associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of  their own lives with stronger families, more educational opportunity,  economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.  
1996_12	1996_12	To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must  expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together.  
1996_15	1996_15	Deficit  
1996_18	1996_18	These cuts are real. They will require sacrifice from everyone. But these  cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our  children, and our future, by endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or  education, or the environment, or by raising taxes on working families.  
1996_19	1996_19	I have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of  our negotiations. I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and  Democrats view the debate before us. I have learned a lot about the good  ideas that we could all embrace.  
1996_21	1996_21	Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow,  beyond the burdens of yesterday. The challenges are significant. But  America was built on challenges, not promises. And when we work together to  meet them, we never fail. That is the key to a more perfect Union. Our  individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.  
1996_23	1996_23	Strengthening Families  
1996_25	1996_25	Before I go on, I would like to take just a moment to thank my own family,  and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25  years about the importance of families and children a wonderful wife, a  magnificent mother and a great First Lady. Thank you, Hillary.  
1996_28	1996_28	I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V_chip in TV sets so that  parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their  children. When parents control what their young children see, that is not  censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility  for their children's upbringing. And I urge them to do it. The V_chip  requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in  this Congress. It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now.  
1996_29	1996_29	To make the V_chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what  movies have done to identify your programming in ways that help parents  to protect their children. And I invite the leaders of major media  corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next  month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what  our children see on television. I am ready to work with you.  
1996_33	1996_33	Let us be candid about this difficult problem. Passing a law, even the best  possible law, is only a first step. The next step is to make it work. I  challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for  independence. I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the  chance to move into the work force. I applaud the work of religious groups  and others who care for the poor. More than anyone else in our society,  they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a  position to help. Every one of us should join them. That is the only way we  can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American  people.  
1996_39	1996_39	Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational  opportunities we will all need for this new century. In our schools, every  classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway,  with computers and good software, and well_trained teachers. We are working  with the telecommunications industry, educators and parents to connect 20  percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and  every library in the entire United States by the year 2000. I ask Congress  to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure  this national partnership succeeds.  
1996_40	1996_40	Every diploma ought to mean something. I challenge every community, every  school and every state to adopt national standards of excellence; to  measure whether schools are meeting those standards; to cut bureaucratic  red tape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grass_roots  reform; and to hold them accountable for results. That's what our Goals  2000 initiative is all about.  
1996_44	1996_44	My fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever  before. We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to  borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan  default rate. That's something we should all be proud of, because it was  unconscionably high just a few years ago. Through AmeriCorps, our national  service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by  serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and  neighbors. These initiatives are right for America and we should keep them  going.  
1996_46	1996_46	Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for  it, achieve economic security in this new age. People who work hard still  need support to get ahead in the new economy. They need education and  training for a lifetime. They need more support for families raising  children. They need retirement security. They need access to health care.  More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood  simply doesn't last a lifetime.  
1996_47	1996_47	G.I. Bill For Workers  
1996_48	1996_48	So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated  job_training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or  underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition  or other training. This is a G.I. Bill for America's workers we should all  be able to agree on.  
1996_49	1996_49	More and more Americans are working hard without a raise. Congress sets the  minimum wage. Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40_year low in  purchasing power. Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a living  wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on  it. I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.  
1996_50	1996_50	In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard_pressed working families  to make sure that no parents who work full_time would have to raise their  children in poverty, and to encourage people to move from welfare to work.  This expanded earned income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to  a family of four living on $20,000. The budget bill I vetoed would have  reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these  people. We should not do that.  
1996_51	1996_51	I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not  all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising  their children and at work. I agree that we need a tax credit for working  families with children. That's one of the things most of us in this  Chamber, I hope, can agree on. I know it is strongly supported by the  Republican majority. And it should be part of any final budget agreement.  
1996_52	1996_52	I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide  pensions for your employees. And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal  recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make  it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension  plans. That is something we should all agree on.  
1996_53	1996_53	We should also protect existing pension plans. Two years ago, with  bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we  moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize  the pensions of 32 million more. Congress should not now let companies  endanger those workers' pension funds. I know the proposal to liberalize  the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other  purposes would raise money for the treasury. But I believe it is false  economy. I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so  again.  
1996_55	1996_55	Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy,  they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose  when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick. Over the  past two years, over one million Americans in working families have lost  their health insurance. We have to do more to make health care available to  every American. And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill  sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require  insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop  denying coverage for preexisting conditions. Let's all do that.  
1996_58	1996_58	The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing,  pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of  Medicare and Medicaid these things, along with the Family and Medical  Leave Act passed in 1993 these things will help responsible, hard_working  American families to make the most of their own lives.  
1996_59	1996_59	But employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing  in so many of our finest companies working together, putting the  long_term prosperity ahead of the short_term gain. As workers increase  their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the  skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the  burdens of the bad ones. When companies and workers work as a team they do  better, and so does America.  
1996_62	1996_62	The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing. It  provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We're  already a third of the way there. And I challenge the Congress to finish  the job. Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime  rate coming down.  
1996_66	1996_66	And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal  gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants.  From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs  should be one strike and you're out.  
1996_69	1996_69	Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem.  The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children  openly and firmly. It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth  groups and our schools.  
1996_72	1996_72	General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars  fighting for this country. Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle  against drugs at home and abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger  than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has  a role to play on this team.  
1996_75	1996_75	Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next  generation. Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner  water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent,  toxic emissions from factories cut in half. Lake Erie was dead, and now  it's a thriving resource. But 10 million children under 12 still live  within four miles of a toxic waste dump. A third of us breathe air that  endangers our health. And in too many communities, the water is not safe to  drink. We still have much to do.  
1996_76	1996_76	Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent. That  means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more  pesticides in our food. Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write  their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and  safety of our children. Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab  for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook. I  challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.  
1996_78	1996_78	We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in  protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do  it. To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper,  more efficient way than government regulations require to meet tough  pollution standards, do it as long as you do it right. To communities we  say: We must strengthen community right_to_know laws requiring polluters to  disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with  business to cut pollution. People do have a right to know that their air  and their water are safe.  
1996_79	1996_79	Foreign Policy  
1996_81	1996_81	We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II. I would like to  say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in  World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought  bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service, and so do the  American people.  
1996_85	1996_85	We must not be the world's policeman. But we can and should be the world's  very best peacemaker. By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy  where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the  risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people  here and around the world. For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear  age, there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children.  
1996_86	1996_86	North Korea  
1996_87	1996_87	North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program. In Haiti,  the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate  refugees to our shores has subsided. Through tougher trade deals for  America over 80 of them we have opened markets abroad, and now exports  are at an all_time high, growing faster than imports and creating good  American jobs.  
1996_90	1996_90	Bosnia  
1996_91	1996_91	And we stood up for peace in Bosnia. Remember the skeletal prisoners, the  mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of  refugees, the threat of a spreading war. All these threats, all these  horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace. Now, our troops  and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from Central Europe and  elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold.  
1996_96	1996_96	As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison  gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention this  year. We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals  at home and abroad if Congress passes the anti_terrorism legislation I  proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing now. We can help more people  move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if  Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.  
1996_97	1996_97	My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all  of us. Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us  in this hallowed hall tonight: to reinvent our government and make our  democracy work for them.  
1996_98	1996_98	Reform  
1996_103	1996_103	As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller government, we must  work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives. We  are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy, but with more  opportunities. Through our successful Empowerment Zones and Community  Development Banks, we are helping people to find jobs, to start businesses.  And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial  property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately  need them.  
1996_106	1996_106	I want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal  government. Today our federal government is 200,000 employees smaller than  it was the day I took office as President.  
1996_107	1996_107	Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and  it's getting smaller every day. Most of our fellow Americans probably don't  know that. And there is a good reason: The remaining federal work force is  composed of Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than  ever before, to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.  
1996_108	1996_108	I'd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49  year_old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security  Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the  Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and  brought the rubble down all around him. He reentered that building four  times. He saved the lives of three women. He's here with us this evening,  and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his  extraordinary personal heroism.  
1996_110	1996_110	On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are  out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I  challenge all of you in this Chamber: Never, ever shut the federal  government down again.  
1996_116	1996_116	Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives.  None of us can finish the race alone. We can only achieve our destiny  together one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another.  
1997_5	1997_5	My fellow Americans, the state of our union is strong, but now we must rise  to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we  have ever known.  
1997_9	1997_9	The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.  
1997_10	1997_10	We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans,  responsibility from all Americans in a community of all Americans. And we  must be committed to a new kind of government: not to solve all our  problems for us, but to give our people all our people the tools they  need to make the most of their own lives. And we must work together.  
1997_11	1997_11	The people of this nation elected us all. They want us to be partners, not  partisans. They put us all right here in the same boat. They gave us all  oars, and they told us to row. Now, here is the direction I believe we  should take.  
1997_14	1997_14	Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world. We here tonight  have an historic opportunity. Let this Congress be the Congress that  finally balances the budget. Thank you.  
1997_16	1997_16	It will balance the budget and provide middle_class tax relief to pay for  education and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell a  home.  
1997_17	1997_17	Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature. It does not  require us to rewrite our Constitution. I believe, I believe it is both  unnecessary, unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple  our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as  judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes.  
1997_23	1997_23	So let's set our own deadline. Let's work together to write bipartisan  campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain_Feingold by the day we  celebrate the birth of our democracy, July the 4th.  
1997_25	1997_25	Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire  people off welfare; Incentives for job placement firms in states to create  more jobs for welfare recipients; Training, transportation and child care  to help people go to work. Now I challenge every state turn those welfare  checks into private sector paychecks. I challenge every religious  congregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off  welfare. And I'd like to say especially to every employer in our country  who ever criticized the old welfare system, you can't blame that old system  anymore; we have torn it down. Now, do your part. Give someone on welfare  the chance to go to work.  
1997_27	1997_27	We passed welfare reform. All of you know I believe we were right to do it.  But no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you  are prepared to finish the job.  
1997_29	1997_29	Now, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold to the  future we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next four  years, is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the  world. Thank you.  
1997_37	1997_37	Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers. Most of  us in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those  teachers. I know that I wouldn't be here.  
1997_38	1997_38	For years many of our educators, led by North Carolina's governor, Jim  Hunt, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have  worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for  excellence in teaching.  
1997_43	1997_43	You must use these tutors to help your students read. And it is especially  a challenge to our parents. You must read with your children every night.  
1997_47	1997_47	Fifth, every state should give parents the power to choose the right public  school for their children. Their right to choose will foster competition  and innovation that can make public schools better. We should also make it  possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools  that set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do.  
1997_59	1997_59	That is my plan a call to action for American education. Some may say  that it is unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to  education. Some may say it is simply because the president and his  wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than  they can recall. That is not what is driving these proposals. We must  understand the significance of this endeavor.  
1997_61	1997_61	To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful  forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the  first State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet, but we've  only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should  become the modern birthright of every citizen.  
1997_63	1997_63	And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every  children's hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay in  touch with school, family and friends. A sick child need no longer be a  child alone.  
1997_65	1997_65	As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home: a  teacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures. This will no longer  be a dream, but a necessity. And over the next decade, that must be our  goal.  
1997_66	1997_66	We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes  and the International Space Station, both of which will have practical  applications for our everyday living.  
1997_69	1997_69	To prepare America for the 21st century we must build stronger families.  Over the past four years the Family and Medical Leave Law has helped  millions of Americans to take time off to be with their families.  
1997_72	1997_72	My my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of  those children. Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance  do so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also  ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep  their health insurance. No child should be without a doctor just because a  parent is without a job.  
1997_77	1997_77	Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our  determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that  endanger their lives.  
1997_82	1997_82	We should double the number of empowerment zones. They've already brought  so much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has  been cut in half in four years. We should restore contaminated urban land  and buildings to constructive use. We should expand the network of  community development banks.  
1997_86	1997_86	Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands.  Tonight I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage  Rivers to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and  clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the  economy as we protect the environment.  
1997_87	1997_87	We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic  chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even  as they change our climate.  
1997_89	1997_89	Our national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young  people to work their way through college as they serve America. Now we  intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways.  Citizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should  embrace. And I ask your support for that endeavor.  
1997_100	1997_100	Our prosperity requires it. More than 2 million American jobs depend upon  trade with Asia. There, too, we are helping to shape an Asia Pacific  community of cooperation, not conflict.  
1997_110	1997_110	Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security. In the  past four years, we agreed to ban we led the way to a worldwide agreement  to ban nuclear testing.  
1997_111	1997_111	With Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals and we stopped targeting  each other's citizens. We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from  falling into the wrong hands, and to rid the world of land mines.  
1997_113	1997_113	Now we must rise to a new test of leadership ratifying the Chemical  Weapons Convention. Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer  from chemical attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more  important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the  Gulf War.  
1997_115	1997_115	Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges. We must  maintain a strong and ready military. We must increase funding for weapons  modernization by the year 2000. And we must take good care of our men and  women in uniform. They are the world's finest.  
1997_120	1997_120	In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the  power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as  one America.  
1997_121	1997_121	All over the world people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic and  religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror. We are the world's  most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is  possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences.  America has always been a nation of immigrants.  
1997_123	1997_123	My fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a  weakness; it is our greatest strength.  
1997_125	1997_125	We're not there yet. We still see evidence of a biting bigotry and  intolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed  buildings. We must fight against this in our country and in our hearts.  
1997_128	1997_128	I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how. Congressman  Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from  Mexico. He was only 51 years old. He was awarded the Silver Star, the  Bronze Star and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam. And  he went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this  chamber.  
1997_130	1997_130	Gary Locke, the newly_elected governor of Washington state, is the first  Chinese_American governor in the history of our country. He's the proud son  of two of the millions of Asian American immigrants who strengthened  America with their hard work, family values and good citizenship.  
1997_131	1997_131	He represents the future we can all achieve. Thank you, governor, for being  here. Please stand up.  
1998_6	1998_6	This is the America we have begun to build. This is the America we can  leave to our children if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let  us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.  
1998_8	1998_8	For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans  have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of  America, widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our  freedom, forging a more perfect union. We shaped a new kind of government  for the information age. I thank the vice president for his leadership, and  the Congress for its support, in building a government that is leaner, more  flexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a government that  gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own  lives.  
1998_11	1998_11	First, Americans in this chamber and across this nation have pursued a new  strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur  growth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and  transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for  American products and American workers.  
1998_13	1998_13	For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the  damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce  that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensively large that it had 11  zeros, will be simply zero.  
1998_14	1998_14	I will submit to Congress, for 1999, the first balanced budget in 30  years.  
1998_15	1998_15	And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this  year four years ahead of schedule.  
1998_18	1998_18	We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk  reopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so  that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in  20 years.  
1998_20	1998_20	But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet  this test: approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished  without adding a dime to the deficit.  
1998_22	1998_22	I have a simple four_word answer: Save Social Security first.  
1998_23	1998_23	Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus that's  every penny of any surplus until we have taken all the necessary measures  to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.  
1998_24	1998_24	Let us say let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're  70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social  Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment:  Social Security first. Let's do that together.  
1998_26	1998_26	In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap  the rewards of prosperity. Because these times are good, we can afford to  take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to  provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.  
1998_29	1998_29	Last year I proposed and you passed 220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships  for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to  repay now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can  put their savings into new, tax_free education IRAs.  
1998_32	1998_32	Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal  in the 21st century as high school is today. And, my friends, that will  change the face and future of America.  
1998_33	1998_33	We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher  education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the  world's best as well by raising standards, raising expectations and raising  accountability.  
1998_36	1998_36	Tonight, I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in  the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire a hundred thousand  new teachers who have passed the state competency tests. Now with these  teachers listen with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce  class size in the first, second and third grades to an average of 18  students a class all across America.  
1998_37	1998_37	Now, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes  requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut  to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.  
1998_43	1998_43	In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with  240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the  proud stamp, "Made in the USA." Today, record high exports account for  fully one_third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because  that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable  world.  
1998_44	1998_44	Now, all of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great  opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive  trade agreements. I have listened carefully, and I believe that the  opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will  have lower environmental and labor standards, which will give them an  unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if  there's more business; and second, that if we have more trade, more of our  workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.  
1998_47	1998_47	We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left  behind with the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may  have nothing to do with trade. That's why we have more than doubled funding  for training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget is  adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more, and more  quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.  
1998_62	1998_62	For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana was on and off  welfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough  money to move her family into a good neighborhood. And she's helping other  welfare recipients go to work.  
1998_64	1998_64	We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a  success; providing child care, helping families move closer to available  jobs, challenging more companies to join our Welfare to Work Partnership,  increasing child_support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty  to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring  some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard.  And I hope you will finish that job this year.  
1998_74	1998_74	Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at  home and at work. Last year, I co_hosted the very first White House  conference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's first  lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message without regard  to region or income or political affiliation we've got to raise the quality  of child care, we've got to make it safer, we've got to make it more  affordable.  
1998_75	1998_75	So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more  children; scholarships and background checks for child_care workers, and a  new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide  child care for their employees; and a larger child_care tax credit for  working families.  
1998_86	1998_86	These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of  information and ideas and people, and they will be all the more lethal if  weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands. To meet these  challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the  21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating  those who do not.  
1998_91	1998_91	I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud  of what they are doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them. One of  those one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the first lady tonight:  Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet.  After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry  unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that  is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much,  Sergeant, for what you represent.  
1998_93	1998_93	I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the  serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades  after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a Comprehensive  Nuclear Test Ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to  prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons, and make it more  difficult for non_nuclear states to build them.  
1998_94	1998_94	I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones, and  Admiral William Crowe have endorsed this treaty, and I ask the Senate to  approve it this year.  
1998_95	1998_95	Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological  weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking  to acquire them.  
1998_96	1998_96	Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his  nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing  nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them.  
1998_98	1998_98	I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats,  when I say to Saddam Hussein, "You cannot defy the will of the world," and  when I say to him, "You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we  are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."  
1998_107	1998_107	Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We  need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer  advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.  
1998_112	1998_112	Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still  the gateway for new immigrants from every continent who come here to work  for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the  21st Century. They're a very important part of our future.  
1998_114	1998_114	Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to  protect consumers from dangers like e. coli and salmonella.  
1998_115	1998_115	Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water initiative, a  far_reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters  for our children.  
1998_116	1998_116	Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of  climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires  worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded  unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases at  some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our  children and grandchildren at risk.  
1998_118	1998_118	We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion  in tax cuts, in research and development, to encourage innovation,  renewable energy, fuel_efficient cars, energy_efficient homes. Every time  we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would  hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation,  and our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a  way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And  when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again.  
1998_121	1998_121	And we all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all  want our children to grow up in the world where their talents are matched  by their opportunities.  
1998_123	1998_123	Discrimination against any American is un_American. We must vigorously  enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog  at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our  fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to  end their wait.  
1998_125	1998_125	We in this chamber and in this government must do all we can to address the  continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move  forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home  watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.  
1998_128	1998_128	In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we  mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years. This year,  Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote  America's creativity and innovation and to preserve our heritage and  culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and  every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as  Americans. We should protect them.  
1998_130	1998_130	Now, think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles  every five years. In the 1980s, scientists identified the gene causing  cystic fibrosis; it took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene  that causes Parkinson's disease in only nine days! Within a decade, gene  chips will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a  lifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day  on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998  may well live to see the 22nd century.  
1998_134	1998_134	Now in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions  of Americans surf the Net every day.  
1998_139	1998_139	John, you will carry with you America's hopes, and on your uniform once  again you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection  between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.  
1999_1	1999_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my  fellow Americans:  
1999_2	1999_2	Tonight I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.  
1999_3	1999_3	Let me begin by saluting the new speaker of the House and thanking him  especially tonight for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the  gallery with Mrs. Hastert. Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut are the widows  of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to  defend freedom's house.  
1999_4	1999_4	Mr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work together in a  spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.  
1999_6	1999_6	For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit  of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. And  now, we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.  
1999_7	1999_7	Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest  violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a  quarter century.  
1999_10	1999_10	My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of  our union is strong. Now, America is working again. The promise of our  future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum  of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far  into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today.  
1999_17	1999_17	Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for  the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the  private sector just as any private or state government pension would do.  This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55  years.  
1999_19	1999_19	Now, these changes will require difficult, but fully achievable choices  over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a  bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you  tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses in both parties  and ask that we join together in saying to the American people, we will  save Social Security now.  
1999_20	1999_20	Now, last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it  would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of  it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First  thing's first.  
1999_21	1999_21	Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation  to save and improve Medicare. Already we have extended the life of the  Medicare trust fund by 10 years, but we should extend it for at least  another decade. Tonight, I propose that we use one out of every six dollars  in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare  until the year 2020.  
1999_22	1999_22	But, again but, again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work  in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of  the Bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure  Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of  seniors affordable prescription drugs.  
1999_27	1999_27	Fourth, we must invest in long_term care.  
1999_28	1999_28	I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and the  families who care for them. Long_term care will become a bigger and bigger  challenge with the aging of America and we must do more to help our  families deal with it.  
1999_30	1999_30	Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us the opportunity  to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it.  
1999_32	1999_32	And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound. Listen to  this, if we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16  percent for Medicare over the next 15 years, that savings will achieve the  lowest level of publicly_held debt since right before World War I in 1917.  
1999_35	1999_35	Today we can say something we couldn't say six years ago. With tax credits  and more affordable student loans, with more work_study grants and more  Pell Grants, with education IRAs, the new HOPE Scholarship tax cut that  more than five million Americans will receive this year, we have finally  opened the doors of college to all Americans.  
1999_37	1999_37	Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to  reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.  
1999_41	1999_41	First, all schools must end social promotion.  
1999_45	1999_45	Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the  quality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine  job, but in too many schools teachers don't have college majors or even  minors in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to pass  performance exams, and all teachers should know the subject their  teaching.  
1999_50	1999_50	Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, and to  respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say  that all states and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible  discipline policies.  
1999_54	1999_54	The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the minimum  wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years.  
1999_60	1999_60	America's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to  bipartisan federal support for medical research, we are not on the verge of  new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's  to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in medical science,  we can't let our medical system lag behind.  
1999_61	1999_61	Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down  costs, but threatening to drive down quality as well.  
1999_64	1999_64	Last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that  opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together  across party lines and pass a strong enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.  
1999_72	1999_72	So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation  plan to take the tobacco companies to court and with the funds we recover  to strengthen Medicare.  
1999_73	1999_73	Now, if we act in these areas minimum wage, family leave, child care,  health care, the safety of our children then we will begin to meet our  generation's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the  21st century.  
1999_79	1999_79	Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national  effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight our welfare_to_work partnership  includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people,  and our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the  dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.  
1999_80	1999_80	We must bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America,  to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta,  to our Native American communities, with more support for community  development banks for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for  affordable housing.  
1999_90	1999_90	To meet it, the U.S. and other nations have reduced interest rates and  strengthened the International Monetary Fund and while the turmoil is not  over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.  
1999_97	1999_97	We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan  guarantees, and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2  billion. I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade based  on these principles. And I ask the Congress to join me again in this common  approach and to give the president the trade authority long used and now  overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.  
1999_100	1999_100	If we do these things invest in our people, our communities, our  technology and lead in the global economy, then we will begin to meet our  historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.  
1999_102	1999_102	All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in  Northern Ireland.  
1999_104	1999_104	All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting  peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we  watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for  the destruction of Israel.  
1999_107	1999_107	We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this  summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing  of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced  every day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them  the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources  they must have so America can continue to lead.  
1999_108	1999_108	We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must  work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies,  to support research into vaccines and treatments. We must increase our  efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea  to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine and  other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology  so they never fall into the wrong hands. Our balanced budget will increase  funding for these critical efforts by almost two_thirds over the next five  years.  
1999_110	1999_110	It's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we  don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to  take this vital step, approve the treaty now to make it harder for other  nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear  testing for ever.  
1999_112	1999_112	America will continue to contain [Iraqi President] Saddam [Hussein] and we  will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people. Now,  last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission  was so flawlessly executed, that we risk taking for granted the bravery and  skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10_year Air Force veteran of  the Air Force, flew a B_1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war  machine. He is here with us tonight. I would like to ask you to honor him  and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox.  
1999_115	1999_115	You know, we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every  community in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today  still stand ready at a moments notice to go where comforts are few and  dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They  always come through for America. We must come through for them.  
1999_117	1999_117	We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia   expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with  Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.  
1999_119	1999_119	But I'd also like to say again to the American people, it's important not  to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the  world will bring change and freedom to China.  
1999_121	1999_121	We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our  common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and  increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely  chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the  blessings of liberty.  
1999_123	1999_123	When the first lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands  of our troops and thousands of American volunteers. In the Dominican  Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by  Dominicans and Americans working side by side. With her was some one else  who has been very important to the relief efforts. You know sports records  are made and sooner or later, they're broken. But making other people's  lives better and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood, that  lasts forever. So for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in  two countries tonight. Thank you.  
1999_124	1999_124	So I say to all of you, if we do these things, if we pursue peace, fight  terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances, we will begin to  meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st  century America in a freer, more peaceful world.  
1999_129	1999_129	I ask Congress to restore the five_day waiting period for buying a handgun  and extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes  from buying a gun.  
1999_130	1999_130	We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities.  Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic  killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were  deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the  hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't  have to live through their loss.  
1999_135	1999_135	But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming.  Nineteen ninety_eight was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat  waves, floods and storm are but a hint of what future generations may  endure if we do not act now.  
1999_136	1999_136	Tonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce  greenhouse and other pollutions, and tax incentives and investment to spur  clean energy technologies. And I want to work with members of Congress in  both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to  reduce greenhouse gases.  
1999_137	1999_137	Now, all our communities face a preservation challenge as they grow, and  green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are  lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives. First, a $1  billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic  congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life.  And second, a $1 billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of  natural beauty all across America, from the most remote wilderness to the  nearest city park.  
1999_140	1999_140	So far, in just four years, 100,000 young Americans have built low_income  homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped tutor children with churches, work  with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters and performed countless  other acts of service that has made America better. I ask Congress to give  more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in  AmeriCorps.  
1999_142	1999_142	And I'd like to say to the Senate, I hope you will say yes to a stronger  American democracy in the year 2000.  
1999_147	1999_147	The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know  that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either.  Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender,  disability or sexual orientation, is wrong and it ought to be illegal.  Therefore, I ask Congress to make the Employment Non_Discrimination Act and  the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the land.  
1999_148	1999_148	You know, now since every person in America counts, every American ought to  be counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do  that.  
1999_149	1999_149	Our new immigrants must be part of our one America. After all, they're  revitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, they're building  up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and  they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life.  
1999_151	1999_151	Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet  their responsibility. I hope you will support it.  
1999_153	1999_153	You know, barely more than 300 days from now we will cross that bridge into  the new millennium. This is a moment, as the first lady has said, to honor  the past and imagine the future.  
1999_155	1999_155	Last year last year I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the  millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary's traveled all across the  country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas  Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home.  
1999_162	1999_162	We are now, at the end of a century, when generation after generation of  Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming Depression, lifting up  the dispossessed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the  largest middle class in history, winning two world wars and the "long  twilight struggle" of the Cold War.  
1999_164	1999_164	Yet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we  don't see our own time for what it truly is a new dawn for America.  
1999_165	1999_165	A hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in this  place and report on the State of the Union. He or she will look back on  the 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and  now.  
2000_2	2000_2	We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has  our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so  little internal crisis or so few external threats. Never before have we had  such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation   to build the more perfect union of our founders' dreams.  
2000_6	2000_6	Our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American  spirit: Crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years. Teen  births down seven years in a row and adoptions up by 30 percent. Welfare  rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years.  
2000_7	2000_7	My fellow Americans, the state of our union is the strongest it has ever  been.  
2000_10	2000_10	Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much  to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our nation was gripped by economic  distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best_selling  book asked: "America: What went wrong?"  
2000_11	2000_11	In the best traditions of our nation, Americans determined to set things  right. We restored the vital center, replacing outdated ideologies with a  new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all,  responsibility from all, and a community of all Americans.  
2000_14	2000_14	We ended welfare as we knew it requiring work while protecting health  care and nutrition for children, and investing more in child care,  transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We have  helped parents to succeed at work and at home with family leave, which 20  million Americans have used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved  one. We have engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through  AmeriCorps while also helping them earn their way through college.  
2000_21	2000_21	These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all  this year. Not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember  that the first American revolution was not won with a single shot. The  continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history and  the lesson of the last seven years is that great goals are reached step  by step: always building on our progress, always gaining ground.  
2000_25	2000_25	In 1993, we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit  Reduction Act, winning passage in both houses by just one vote. Your former  colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort. He is here  tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well.  
2000_27	2000_27	But this is just the start of our journey. Now we must take the right steps  toward reaching our great goals.  
2000_35	2000_35	Let's double our investment in afterschool and summer school programs   boosting achievement, and keeping children off the street and out of  trouble. If we do, we can give every child in every failing school in  America the chance to meet high standards.  
2000_41	2000_41	But we can't finish the job when a third of all schools are in serious  disrepair, many with walls and wires too old for the Internet. Tonight, I  propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate, urgent repairs. And  again, to help build or modernize 6,000 schools, to get students out of  trailers and into high_tech classrooms.  
2000_46	2000_46	Rewarding Work and Strengthening Families  
2000_49	2000_49	But there are still more than 40 million Americans without health  insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow  Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents eligible for  the insurance that covers their kids. Together with our children's  initiative, we can cover nearly one quarter of the uninsured in America.  
2000_50	2000_50	Again, I ask you to let people between 55 and 65 the fastest growing  group of uninsured buy into Medicare. And let's give them a tax credit to  make that choice an affordable one.  
2000_51	2000_51	When the Baby Boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice  as many of our citizens and yet it is far from ready to do so. My  generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden.  We must strengthen and modernize Medicare now.  
2000_53	2000_53	Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one  creating a Medicare program today would even consider excluding coverage  for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five seniors now lack  dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives.  Millions of older Americans who need prescription drugs the most pay the  highest prices for them.  
2000_54	2000_54	In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to  all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.  
2000_56	2000_56	And we must make needed investments to expand access to mental health care.  I want to thank the person who has led our efforts to break down the  barriers to the decent treatment of mental illness: Tipper Gore.  
2000_57	2000_57	Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health  care in the 35 years since the creation of Medicare a big step toward  assuring health care for all Americans, young and old.  
2000_59	2000_59	Tonight, I propose another major expansion. We should reduce the marriage  penalty for the EITC, making sure it rewards marriage just as it rewards  work. And we should expand the tax credit for families with more than two  children to provide up to $1,100 more in tax relief.  
2000_62	2000_62	Many working parents spend up to a quarter of their income on child care.  Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about two million  children. My child care initiative, along with funds already secured in  welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable  for another 400,000 children.  
2000_64	2000_64	Tens of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as  they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make  use of IRAs and 401_K retirement plans. We should do more to help working  families save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea behind so_called  Individual Development Accounts. Let's take that idea to a new level, with  Retirement Savings Accounts that enable every low_ and moderate_income  family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical  emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions,  however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And to give a major  new tax credit for any small business that provides a meaningful pension to  its workers.  
2000_65	2000_65	Nearly one in three American children grows up in a home without a father.  These children are five times more likely to live in poverty than children  with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible  fatherhood is critical to lifting all children out of poverty.  
2000_67	2000_67	If there is any issue on which we can reach across party lines it is in our  common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Thanks to  overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster  care, supported those who leave it when they turn eighteen, and  dramatically increased the number of foster children going to adoptive  homes. I thank you for that. Of course, I am especially grateful to the  person who has led our efforts from the beginning, and who has worked  tirelessly for children and families for thirty years now: my wife,  Hillary.  
2000_70	2000_70	Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years the longest decline  on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community  police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody  believes America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: let's make  America the safest big country in the world.  
2000_74	2000_74	We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books.  Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But  again, we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and local gun  prosecutors, and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers  and bad_apple dealers. And we must give law enforcement the tools to trace  every gun and every bullet used in a crime in America.  
2000_78	2000_78	Opening New Markets  
2000_80	2000_80	Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. Over the last six  months, I have traveled to many of them joined by many of you, and many  far_sighted business people to shine a spotlight on the enormous  potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from  Watts to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Everywhere I've gone, I've met  talented people eager for opportunity, and able to work. Let's put them to  work.  
2000_81	2000_81	For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing  to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to it?  
2000_83	2000_83	Empowerment Zones have been creating these opportunities for five years  now. We should also increase incentives to invest in them and create more  of them.  
2000_85	2000_85	We must maintain our commitment to community development banks and keep the  community reinvestment act strong so all Americans have access to the  capital they need to buy homes and build businesses.  
2000_88	2000_88	Today, opportunity for all requires something new: having access to a  computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital  divide between those who have these tools and those who don't.  
2000_101	2000_101	A second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts that pose the  risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. America cannot prevent  every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake  and we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers.  
2000_104	2000_104	When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John  Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another  American plane went down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air  defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our armed forces' skill  and bravery, we prevailed without losing a single American in combat.  Captain Cherrey, we honor you, and promise to finish the job you began.  
2000_107	2000_107	I hope we can have a constructive bipartisan dialogue this year to build a  consensus which will lead eventually to the ratification of the  Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  
2000_113	2000_113	If we meet all these challenges, America can lead the world toward peace  and freedom in an era of globalization.  
2000_115	2000_115	I am grateful for the opportunities the Vice President and I have had to  work hard to protect the environment and finally to put to rest the notion  that you can't expand the economy while protecting the environment. As our  economy has grown, we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste  and ensured cleaner air and water for millions of families. In the past  three months alone, we have acted to preserve more than 40 million acres of  roadless lands in our National Forests and created three new National  Monuments.  
2000_116	2000_116	But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must grow as  well. Tonight, I propose creating a permanent conservation fund to restore  wildlife, protect coastlines, and save natural treasures from California  redwoods to the Everglades. This Lands Legacy endowment represents by far  the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed.  
2000_125	2000_125	Science and engineering innovations are also propelling our remarkable  prosperity. Information technology alone now accounts for a third of our  economic growth, with jobs that pay almost 80 percent above the private  sector average. Again, we should keep in mind: government_funded research  brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into  being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign  languages as fast as you can speak; materials 10 times stronger than steel  at a fraction of the weight; and molecular computers the size of a teardrop  with the power of today's fastest supercomputers.  
2000_128	2000_128	These steps will allow America to lead toward the far frontiers of science  and technology enhancing our health, environment, and economy in ways we  cannot even imagine today.  
2000_129	2000_129	Community  
2000_130	2000_130	At a time when science, technology and the forces of globalization are  bringing so many changes into our lives, it is more important than ever  that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in  our national communities.  
2000_133	2000_133	We should do more to help new immigrants fully participate in the American  community investing more to teach them civics and English. And since  everyone in our community counts, we must make sure everyone is counted in  this year's census.  
2000_134	2000_134	Within ten years there will be no majority race in our largest state,  California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race  in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our  greatest strength. Just look around this chamber. We have members from  virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And America is  stronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all too often spark  hatred and division, even here at home.  
2000_139	2000_139	Therefore, we must do more than tolerate diversity we must honor it and  celebrate it.  
2000_142	2000_142	When the framers finished crafting our Constitution, Benjamin Franklin  stood in Independence Hall and reflected on a painting of the sun, low on  the horizon. He said, "I have often wondered whether that sun was rising or  setting. Today," Franklin said, "I have the happiness to know it is a  rising sun." Well, today, because each generation of Americans has kept the  fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility,  we still bask in the warmth of Mr. Franklin's rising sun.  
2001_1	2001_1	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country. I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight. I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it could have been a close vote. So, Mr. Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie.  
2001_4	2001_4	I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making progress. Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's Capital. And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be judged by what we're able to accomplish.  
2001_6	2001_6	Neither picture is complete in and of itself. And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people. Some of these resources will come from government. Some, but not all.  
2001_9	2001_9	It is reasonable, and it is responsible. It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs. We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement programs, by $81 billion. We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation. My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt. And then, when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place.  
2001_17	2001_17	Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so. To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years. My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low_income seniors. No senior in America should have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions.  
2001_18	2001_18	To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and for Social Security alone.  
2001_23	2001_23	My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming. For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality.  
2001_29	2001_29	Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems.  
2001_30	2001_30	With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia. Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. Mayor Street has encouraged faith_based and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia. He's invited me to his city this summer to see compassionate action. I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is. Mayor Street's a Democrat. Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. But some things are bigger than politics. So I look forward to coming to your city, to see your faith_based programs in action.  
2001_32	2001_32	Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong and we will end it in America. In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers. They protect us every day often at great risk. But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve.  
2001_33	2001_33	My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations. It has funded our nation's important priorities. It has protected Social Security and Medicare. And our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.  
2001_34	2001_34	Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt. I listened, and I agree. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history.  
2001_36	2001_36	We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent. We have funded our priorities. We paid down all the available debt. We have prepared for contingencies. And we still have money left over.  
2001_40	2001_40	Some say my tax plan is too big. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This plan is just right. I didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief. I didn't take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good. I looked at problems in the Tax Code and calculated the cost to fix them.  
2001_41	2001_41	A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal income taxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent.  
2001_44	2001_44	These changes add up to significant help. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months. That's real money.  
2001_48	2001_48	For lower_income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness. Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work. A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000. Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 20 percent. This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over_taxed time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely.  
2001_49	2001_49	Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent. The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering. Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves.  
2001_53	2001_53	America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism. We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom. We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from oppression. Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend. We will promote our values. We will promote the peace. And we need a strong military to keep the peace.  
2001_54	2001_54	But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past. So I've asked the Secretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats. My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required. Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending. Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around.  
2001_56	2001_56	And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom.  
2001_59	2001_59	Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more energy_independent, and we will.  
2001_64	2001_64	Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return. Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few. They are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.  
2002_1	2002_1	Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of  Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our  nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized world  faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has never been  stronger. (Applause.)  
2002_3	2002_3	The American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who  once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)  And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are  running for their own. (Applause.)  
2002_4	2002_4	America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We'll be partners in  rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcome the distinguished  interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid Karzai.  (Applause.)  
2002_6	2002_6	Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the  resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military.  (Applause.) When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete  confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks to them, we are  winning the war on terror. (Applause.) The men and women of our Armed  Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United  States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on  mountaintops and in caves you will not escape the justice of this  nation. (Applause.)  
2002_9	2002_9	Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is  just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and all who  gave their lives for freedom.  
2002_10	2002_10	Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan  confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task ahead.  We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos, where they laugh  about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their hatred is equaled  by the madness of the destruction they design. We have found diagrams of  American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, detailed  instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American  cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout  the world.  
2002_11	2002_11	What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our  war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked  planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps, and so  were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled  in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread  throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without  warning.  
2002_15	2002_15	While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting  elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that  country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an  American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian  government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy. Our  Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and  the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.  
2002_19	2002_19	Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an  unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.  
2002_20	2002_20	Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support  terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and  nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used  poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens leaving the bodies of  mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to  international inspections then kicked out the inspectors. This is a  regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.  
2002_21	2002_21	States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil,  arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass  destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could  provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their  hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United  States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be  catastrophic.  
2002_25	2002_25	We can't stop short. If we stop now leaving terror camps intact and  terror states unchecked our sense of security would be false and  temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it is  both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.  (Applause.)  
2002_27	2002_27	September the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this  Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and  resolve. (Applause.) Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit  directed toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud member of my  party yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs  in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as  Democrats, but as Americans. (Applause.)  
2002_29	2002_29	My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades   because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too  high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay. (Applause.)  
2002_38	2002_38	Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress must  act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure,  and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less  dependent on foreign oil. (Applause.)  
2002_39	2002_39	Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new  jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority.  (Applause.) On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of  Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass  this legislation. (Applause.)  
2002_45	2002_45	Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social  Security, and we will. We must make Social Security financially stable and  allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.  (Applause.)  
2002_46	2002_46	Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues:  productive farm policy (applause) a cleaner environment (applause)   broader home ownership, especially among minorities (applause) and  ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith_based groups.  (Applause.) I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the  same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism.  (Applause.)  
2002_47	2002_47	During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see the  true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies believed  America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and  selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil. (Applause.)  
2002_50	2002_50	None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th.  Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into  a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens,  with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history. We began to  think less of the goods we can accumulate, and more about the good we can  do.  
2002_52	2002_52	My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years 4,000  hours over the rest of your lifetime to the service of your neighbors  and your nation. (Applause.) Many are already serving, and I thank you. If  you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place to start. To sustain and  extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new  USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need:  responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our communities; and  extending American compassion throughout the world.  
2002_54	2002_54	Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We need  mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison.  And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA Freedom Corps  will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to  recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.  
2002_55	2002_55	And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every  part of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double  its volunteers over the next five years (applause) and ask it to join  a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the  Islamic world. (Applause.)  
2002_56	2002_56	This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity a moment we  must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering momentum of  millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can  overcome evil with greater good. (Applause.) And we have a great  opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values  that will bring lasting peace.  
2002_58	2002_58	If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic  "street" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the  skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of learning,  and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defending liberty and  justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people  everywhere. (Applause.)  
2002_59	2002_59	No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We  have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand  firm for the non_negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law;  limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free  speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance. (Applause.)  
2002_61	2002_61	In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries.  America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never  before, to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free markets and  free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives.  Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and Africa to Latin  America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the  momentum of freedom. (Applause.)  
2002_63	2002_63	In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the  history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human  events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.  
2002_65	2002_65	Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's price.  We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my fellow  Americans, we will see freedom's victory.  
2003_4	2003_4	This country has many challenges. We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to other presidents, and other generations. We will confront them with focus and clarity and courage.  
2003_5	2003_5	During the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together. To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform which must now be carried out in every school and in every classroom, so that every child in America can read and learn and succeed in life. To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security, which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era. To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation. To insist on integrity in American business we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account.  
2003_11	2003_11	You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years. If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today.  
2003_15	2003_15	A growing economy and a focus on essential priorities will also be crucial to the future of Social Security. As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own.  
2003_16	2003_16	Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation, with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives. Yet for many people, medical care costs too much and many have no coverage at all. These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.  
2003_19	2003_19	Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is. And just like you the members of Congress, and your staffs, and other federal employees all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs.  
2003_20	2003_20	My budget will commit an additional $400 billion over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare. Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare. I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.  
2003_22	2003_22	Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment. I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70_percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years. I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest.  
2003_26	2003_26	Join me in this important innovation to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy.  
2003_38	2003_38	Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, "We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die." In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words.  
2003_42	2003_42	This nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature. And this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man_made evil of international terrorism.  
2003_44	2003_44	To date, we've arrested or otherwise dealt with many key commanders of al Qaeda. They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September the 11th attacks; the chief of al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf, who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole; an al Qaeda operations chief from Southeast Asia; a former director of al Qaeda's training camps in Afghanistan; a key al Qaeda operative in Europe; a major al Qaeda leader in Yemen. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way they are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies.  
2003_46	2003_46	We have the terrorists on the run. We're keeping them on the run. One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice.  
2003_52	2003_52	This threat is new; America's duty is familiar. Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America.  
2003_53	2003_53	Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror. Once again, this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm. Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind. And we accept this responsibility.  
2003_56	2003_56	Different threats require different strategies. In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror. We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty and human rights and democracy. Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government and determine their own destiny and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom.  
2003_57	2003_57	On the Korean Peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation. Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons. We now know that that regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along. And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. America and the world will not be blackmailed.  
2003_59	2003_59	Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean Peninsula and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.  
2003_64	2003_64	Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. In such quantities, these chemical agents could also kill untold thousands. He's not accounted for these materials. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.  
2003_65	2003_65	U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence. Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions. He's given no evidence that he has destroyed them.  
2003_74	2003_74	The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning.  
2003_76	2003_76	The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, and our friends and our allies. The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council to convene on February the 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world. Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraqi's legal Iraq's illegal weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups.  
2003_77	2003_77	We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.  
2003_78	2003_78	Tonight I have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in or near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lay ahead. In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you. Your training has prepared you. Your honor will guide you. You believe in America, and America believes in you.  
2003_83	2003_83	Americans are a resolute people who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world and to ourselves. America is a strong nation, and honorable in the use of our strength. We exercise power without conquest, and we sacrifice for the liberty of strangers.  
2003_84	2003_84	Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.  
2004_4	2004_4	Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders. And their vigilance is protecting America.  
2004_9	2004_9	Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people. Twenty_eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 over two years without an attack on American soil and it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting and false. The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombassa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad. The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world. And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated.  
2004_10	2004_10	Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us. And one of those essential tools is the PATRIOT Act, which allows Federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets. For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers. If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. Key provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire next year. The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens you need to renew the PATRIOT Act.  
2004_16	2004_16	The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right. And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right. Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man. Today our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law, with a bill of rights. We are working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June. As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear. They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends but the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom.  
2004_24	2004_24	Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized. This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their sacrifices. From the beginning, America has sought international support for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support. There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few. America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people.  
2004_26	2004_26	As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East. We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friends. To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian and soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region. I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the development of free elections, free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East. And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light the way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world.  
2004_27	2004_27	America is a Nation with a mission and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic peace a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great Republic will lead the cause of freedom.  
2004_28	2004_28	In these last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy. We have come through recession, and terrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war. And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong, and growing stronger.  
2004_30	2004_30	Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward. The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years. New home construction: the highest in almost 20 years. Home ownership rates: the highest ever. Manufacturing activity is increasing. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low. Exports are growing. Productivity is high. And jobs are on the rise.  
2004_33	2004_33	All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools. Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered. By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country. We are providing more funding for our schools a 36 percent increase since 2001. We are requiring higher standards. We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals. We are reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing. We are making progress toward excellence for every child.  
2004_45	2004_45	In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. For a monthly premium of about 35 dollars, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half. Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best just as you, as Members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs. And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax_free for their medical expenses, in a health savings account.  
2004_53	2004_53	To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face even when they are difficult to talk about. Each year, about three million teenagers contract sexually transmitted diseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming parents. In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks. We will double Federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Decisions children make now can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives. All of us parents, schools, government must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture, and to send the right messages to our children.  
2004_54	2004_54	A strong America must also value the institution of marriage. I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization. Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton. That statute protects marriage under Federal law as the union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states. Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.  
2004_61	2004_61	May God bless the United States of America. Thank you.  
2005_4	2005_4	Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world the state of our union is confident and strong.  
2005_5	2005_5	Our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice. Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror or a lot of gray and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union? Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done, and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren.  
2005_7	2005_7	Now we must add to these achievements. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world.  
2005_16	2005_16	Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in any way. For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were much lower than they are today. And a half_century ago, about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.  
2005_19	2005_19	I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. If you have a five_year_old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.  
2005_23	2005_23	Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away.  
2005_25	2005_25	Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly_based investment funds. It's time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans.  
2005_31	2005_31	Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women.  
2005_32	2005_32	Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.  
2005_33	2005_33	Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy and chief among them is freedom from fear.  
2005_35	2005_35	Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders but many of its top commanders have been removed. There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists but their number has declined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but no longer without attention and without consequence. Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all and we will stay on the offensive against them, until the fight is won.  
2005_42	2005_42	To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain. The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East.  
2005_44	2005_44	Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq. That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.  
2005_45	2005_45	We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty as they showed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly. A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. She said, "Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."  
2005_47	2005_47	One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al_Suhail. She says of her country, "We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers." Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country and we are honored that she is with us tonight.  
2005_49	2005_49	We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom, and to write their own history. As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, "Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible." That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.  
2005_52	2005_52	Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. We have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud. The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our nation more secure. Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. And we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever.  
2005_53	2005_53	One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah. His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. She wrote, "When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom. Now it is my turn to protect you.'" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood.  
2005_54	2005_54	In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events. We have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory. In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world. We are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.  
2006_4	2006_4	In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another – and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong – and together we will make it stronger.  
2006_10	2006_10	America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the Nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed, and move this world toward peace.  
2006_13	2006_13	And we are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory. First, we are helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased, and the insurgency marginalized. Second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. Third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.  
2006_26	2006_26	It is said that prior to the attacks of September 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al_Qaida operatives overseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack – based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute – I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al_Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from America. Previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have – and Federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed. This terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking with al_Qaida, we want to know about it – because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.  
2006_28	2006_28	Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.  
2006_30	2006_30	The American economy is pre_eminent – but we cannot afford to be complacent. In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India. This creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people’s fears. And so we are seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy – even though this economy could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction – toward a stagnant and second_rate economy.  
2006_37	2006_37	Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow. One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American. With open markets and a level playing field, no one can out_produce or out_compete the American worker.  
2006_41	2006_41	The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Since 2001, we have spent nearly 10 billion dollars to develop cleaner, cheaper, more reliable alternative energy sources – and we are on the threshold of incredible advances. So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative – a 22_percent increase in clean_energy research at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero_emission coal_fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.  
2006_58	2006_58	A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency – and stays at it until they are back on their feet. So far the Federal government has committed 85 billion dollars to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. We are removing debris, repairing highways, and building stronger levees. We are providing business loans and housing assistance. Yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child … and job skills that bring upward mobility … and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.  
2006_60	2006_60	Fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. We have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. And sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.  
2006_62	2006_62	Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. We will lead freedom’s advance. We will compete and excel in the global economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. And so we move forward – optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of victories to come.  
2007_8	2007_8	A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy and that is what we have. We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs so far. Unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, but with more enterprise. (Applause.)  
2007_11	2007_11	Next, there is the matter of earmarks. These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour when not even C_SPAN is watching. (Laughter.) In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You didn't vote them into law. I didn't sign them into law. Yet, they're treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session. (Applause.)  
2007_15	2007_15	A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. (Applause.) When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. (Applause.) But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy.  
2007_21	2007_21	We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. (Applause.) We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. (Applause.) Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and I can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law. (Applause.)  
2007_27	2007_27	America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. (Applause.)  
2007_35	2007_35	Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: "We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse." Osama bin Laden declared: "Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us."  
2007_39	2007_39	This war is more than a clash of arms it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom  
2007_41	2007_41	In the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution, they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. (Applause.)  
2007_42	2007_42	A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.  
2007_46	2007_46	The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open_ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad and they must do so. They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re_enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.  
2007_48	2007_48	If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country and in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.  
2007_50	2007_50	This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I have spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way. (Applause.)  
2007_55	2007_55	We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma [1] and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur. (Applause.)  
2007_56	2007_56	American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required. We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease and that is precisely what America is doing. We must continue to fight HIV/AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa. (Applause.) Because you funded our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving life_saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries. (Applause.)  
2007_59	2007_59	Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa, amid great poverty and disease. He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine but Coach John Thompson got a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. (Laughter.) Dikembe became a star in the NBA, and a citizen of the United States. But he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. A friend has said of this good_hearted man: "Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things." And we are proud to call this son of the Congo [2] a citizen of the United States of America. (Applause.)  
2007_61	2007_61	Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. He insists he's not a hero. He says: "We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. We have got to show each other some love." There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey. (Applause.)  
2007_62	2007_62	Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army. In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. He was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position. For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star. And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country. (Applause.)  
2007_63	2007_63	In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America and these qualities are not in short supply. This is a decent and honorable country and resilient, too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence because the State of our Union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. God bless. (Applause.)  
2008_2	2008_2	All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep.  
2008_4	2008_4	From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done.  
2008_5	2008_5	In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.  
2008_11	2008_11	The people's trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto.  
2008_14	2008_14	To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.  The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control.  So I have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year.  
2008_18	2008_18	Members of Congress: The No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding. And we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law.  
2008_22	2008_22	These agreements also promote America's strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror, and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life.  
2008_23	2008_23	Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help.  I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.  
2008_25	2008_25	This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.  The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy_efficient technology.  
2008_26	2008_26	To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.  
2008_27	2008_27	On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.  
2008_29	2008_29	On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says.  I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up_or_down vote.  
2008_31	2008_31	Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans.  
2008_43	2008_43	While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago.  When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.  
2008_47	2008_47	When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of "return on success," and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home.  
2008_48	2008_48	This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening, I want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you, and more. Our nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation.  And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.  
2008_49	2008_49	Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine Expeditionary Unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home.  
2008_50	2008_50	Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the "disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, al Qaeda_Iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a marked increase in violence." Members of Congress: Having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen.  
2008_51	2008_51	In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad.  We're seeing some encouraging signs. The national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de_Baathification reform. They're now debating a provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel. But after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future.  
2008_61	2008_61	America is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative.  
2008_63	2008_63	America is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria_related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five years.  
2008_64	2008_64	America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past seven years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding (applause.) And as increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation.  I call on the Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.  
2009_4	2009_4	But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this:  
2009_20	2009_20	So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.  
2009_27	2009_27	Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re_finance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about. In fact, the average family who re_finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.  
2009_32	2009_32	I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. So were the American taxpayers. So was I.  
2009_33	2009_33	So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you I get it.  
2009_35	2009_35	That's what this is about. It's not about helping banks it's about helping people. Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car, or open their own business. Investors will return to the market, and American families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover.  
2009_37	2009_37	The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short_term. But the only way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the long_term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.  
2009_39	2009_39	My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.  
2009_41	2009_41	But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long_term challenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.  
2009_43	2009_43	In each case, government didn't supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.  
2009_46	2009_46	We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug_in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea.  
2009_50	2009_50	But to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market_based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. And to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel_efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.  
2009_51	2009_51	As for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision_making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a re_tooled, re_imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.  
2009_58	2009_58	Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why I'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.  
2009_59	2009_59	I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. It will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.  
2009_60	2009_60	The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America.  
2009_67	2009_67	I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country Senator Edward Kennedy.  
2009_69	2009_69	There is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. And that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long_term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down.  
2009_71	2009_71	Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we're starting with the biggest lines. We have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.  
2009_72	2009_72	In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no_bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War_era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.  
2009_78	2009_78	As we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.  
2009_79	2009_79	To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists because living our values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture.  
2009_81	2009_81	To seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To meet the challenges of the 21st century from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.  
2009_83	2009_83	As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead.  
2009_84	2009_84	Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.  
2009_89	2009_89	And I think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help, and says, "We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of South Carolina but also the world. We are not quitters."  
2009_93	2009_93	I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.
