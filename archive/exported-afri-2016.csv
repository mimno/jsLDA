PROJECT,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",1007974,2016-67011-24702,Physicochemical Modification of an Immunodominant Gliadin Peptide with Dietary Polyphenols and the Potential Implications for Celiac Disease,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,70874.0,"Van Buiten, CH, B.",ACTIVE,"Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy that affects 1% of the world population, characterized by adverse reactions to gluten upon consumption, resulting in inflammation and permanent damage to the small intestine. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate ways in which commonly consumed dietary polyphenols found in plant-based foods can attenuate CD-related intestinal permeability and inflammation by interacting with gliadin, the immunostimulatory subunit of gluten. The first objective is to elucidate the mechanism of interaction between gliadin and a series of phenolic compounds and determine the physical characteristics of the complexes formed. The second objective will investigate the effects of gliadin-polyphenol complex (GPC) formation on the stimulation intestinal permeability and inflammation using an in vitro model of the small intestine lining and immune cells. I hypothesize that gliadin will form complexes with phenolic compounds which will modify protein structure, reducing or eliminating the potential for gliadin to stimulate the intestinal damage associated with CD. Alternative therapies for the treatment and prevention of symptoms associated with Celiac disease have been explored extensively, though their availability for general use is limited. The potential development of a supportive treatment of Celiac disease with naturally derived, dietary compounds (e.g., phenolics) would provide a safe and accessible alternative for the prevention or alleviation of symptoms of the associated autoimmune response. This work will advance our understanding of the health benefits of dietary polyphenols and their potential role in alleviating symptoms of chronic diseases initiated by food proteins. This predoctoral research proposal addresses the A7101 program priority: Food, safety nutrition and health, taking an innovative approach to exploring the mitigation of the immunological potential of proteins that are harmful to some individuals using naturally occurring, commonly consumed dietary compounds as a therapeutic agent.","Plant-derived phenolic compounds have been studied extensively for their potential health benefits as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity compounds. However, their role in the attenuation of food allergy and sensitivities has been understudied. Food allergies and sensitivities are characterized by reactions to specific proteins; the natural tendency of polyphenols to interact with protein may prevent or reduce the immunostimulatory effects of these proteins upon consumption.The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the extent to which polyphenols may reduce the immunogenicity of gliadin, the immunostimulatory subunit of gluten, and elucidate the underlying chemical mechanisms of action in an in vitro model of CD. My central hypothesis is that upon exposure to plant-derived polyphenols, gliadin forms protein-polyphenol complexes that have reduced CD-related immunogenicity. This work will provide a potential approach for the mitigation of CD symptoms, and is potentially applicable to other allergy-related food proteins.This project will be outlined by completion of the following objectives:Objective 1. Characterize the interactions that drive complex formation between polyphenols and a2-gliadin and elucidate the impact of interaction on native a2-gliadin structure. I aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which a2-gliadin and polyphenols interact in order to make predictions regarding the extent to which these interactions may modify gliadin structure and, potentially, reduce its immunogenic activity. By binding to and blocking the key epitope regions of the peptide, polyphenols may effectively sequester the peptide from the key receptors in CD pathogenesis that recognize the polyproline II helix motif of a2-gliadin.Objective 2. Investigate the effect of GPC formation on the on CD-related intestinal permeability and inflammation in vitro. In this objective, I seek to measure the effects of GPC formation on increases in intestinal permeability and enterocyte inflammation in vitro. Caco-2 cells grown in a transwell model will be used to simulate the human intestinal barrier; these cells form a polarized mature intestine-like monolayer, and have been used in previous studies to examine gliadin translocation and gut permeability. Caco-2 cells will be co-cultured with monocytes in type I bovine collagen according to previously established methods. This co-culture method better mimics the complexity of the intestinal barrier in vivo by including competent immune cells. In each experiment, gliadin treatments (untreated a2-gliadin control or GPCs) will be added to the apical compartment of the transwell system at 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for 48h.","celiac disease, dietary polyphenol, gliadin, intestinal permeability, protein-polyphenol interaction"
PROJECT,SAES - RUTGERS UNIVERSITY (COOK COLLEGE),1007979,2016-67012-24690,Investigating mechanism-based strategies against trichothecenes and environmental toxins,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,149090.0,"Lee, SA.",ACTIVE,"Trichothecenes areubiquitoustoxic secondary metabolites produced by pathogenic fungi in host plants such as wheat, barley, oats, and maize. Due to their natural occurrence in food and high toxicity, trichothecene contamination of food and livestock feed (&gt;78% toxin present) poses a great threat to food safety and human, animal, and planthealth.However, there is a critical gap in our knowledge about the way the toxin works in living cells leading to toxicity that endangersanimals and humans. Previous studies identified novel mechanisms for trichothecene-induced cell death involving themitochondria, an important component of thecell that functions to help produce energy. These studies have shown that the toxin-induced cell death involved mitochondria and genes involved in lipid metabolisms which mediated sensitivity to these toxins. Therefore, the proposed project will study the role oflipid signaling as a mitochondrial &#39;surveillance&#39; mechanism induced in response to trichothecene-mediated stress.Applying high-throughput methods in molecular biology and biochemistry, this research will identify lipids altered in response to toxin treatment and determine if lipid signaling is important for trichothecene-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. It will also measure therecognition and degradation of trichothecene-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, a selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. The research will identify critical components of the mitochondrial-nuclear signaling pathways using yeast (highly conserved between yeasts and animal cells) and then investigate them in more detail in animal cells. This research will leadto new insights into how these toxins modulate themitochondria and mitochondrial signaling and advance our understanding of mechanisms whereby environmental toxins derail the fate of mitochondria in the affected animals. The knowledge gained here will aid efforts to mitigate the impacts of trichothecene contamination in food and food safety; facilitating the development of safer practice and standards in human and animal consumption of contaminated products.Ultimately, the project will aid in promoting safer food, developing potential applications for animal health improvement, and reducing economic losses due to trichothecene contamination. ","There are twoprimary goals, research and professional development, in this project. First major goal is toidentify critical components of mitochondrial signaling in response to trichothecene-mediated oxidative stress. The project aims to discover the role of lipid and lipid signaling in trichothecene toxicity and provide new ways to quantify mitophagy. Accordingly, the project will address the following objectives:1) Determine the role of lipid signaling in trichothecene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy.2) Determine the role of sphingolipid signaling in trichothecene-induced mitophagy.3) Validate trichothecene-induced mitochondria fragmentation in mammalian cell.Second goal is the professional training and career development of the NIFA postdoctoral fellow. Accordingly, the following objectives are:1) Develop technicalexpertise and knowledge in molecular and biotechnology and toxin mechanism studies including imaging and analysis, flow cytometry, LC-MS/MS, transformation technologies, etc.2) Advance teaching competencies by developing a course focused on science related to postdoctoral fellow&#39;s expertisesuch as plant biology, pathology,and microbiologyand/or scientific communication skill development such as grantsmanship.3) Obtain research independence through publications and generating new grant proposals.4) Leadership and communication skill development through outreach activities such as presentation of research at scientific meetings, guest lectures, publications (formal and informal), and student mentoring in aspects of scientific research and grant writing.","environmental toxins, lipid signaling, mammalian cell, mitochondria, toxicity, trichothecenes, yeast"
PROJECT,SAES - MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1008004,2016-67011-24713,Bovine Leukemia Virus Infection And Its Effect On The Immune Competence Of Dairy Cattle,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,79000.0,"Frie, ME.",ACTIVE,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a common infection in U.S. dairy herds. A 2007 USDA NAHMS study estimated that 83% of U.S. dairy herds are infected with BLV, and approximately 25%-50% of animals within aBLV-positiveherd are infected with BLV. Until recently, BLV was not considered to be economically important to dairy production in the U.S. In contrast, 21 European countries aggressively eradicated the disease and are now considered BLV-free. BLV infection rates in the U.S. are too high for aggressive strategies. Instead, lowering BLV infection rates will depend on producers and management strategies to reduce BLV infection.BLV infection rates in the U.S. are so high because the infection was thought to cause disease very rarely. Only 1%-10% of BLV-infected cows will develop cancer in their lifetime. However, it is likely that BLV has more negative effects on dairy herd health beyond cancer.BLV already costs the dairy industry $520 million every year, due to the lower milk production and shorter life expectancy of BLV-positivecows. BLV infection also likely causes immune suppression, which would put BLV-positivecows at risk for developing other infectious diseases that have a major economic impact on dairy production. The purpose of this project is to determineif BLV-positivecows are immune suppressed. Studying the immune system of BLV-positivecows is important for understanding overall herd health and production in U.S. dairy herds, which makes this project highly relevant to USDA-NIFA.","The first goal of this project is to determineif bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected dairy cows are less able to mount adaptive immune responses to other stimuli when compared to healthy, BLV-uninfected cows. This goal is in line with the larger investigation into whether BLV increases the susceptibility of dairy cows to other infectious diseases of econoomic importance. Because BLV is so widespread in American dairy herds, any immune suppressive effects of BLV infection could have a large, negative impact on both the welfare and production of dairy herds.The second goal of this project is to develop the skills and career of the project director as a scientist. The demands on the project director will enable learning critical skills including, but not limited to, managing a grant, directing a scientific program, scientific writing andgiving scientific presentations.","antibodies, bovine leukemia virus, immune dysfunction, t cells, vaccine"

Certain chemicals already approved to be safe in humans and animals at low levels may increase the rate that bacteria lose antibiotic resistance. This benefit may outweigh the use of such chemicals in agriculture by making foods safer for human consumption. This project will test whether SDS and menthol, two chemical compounds currently present in a variety of human foods and cosmetics, can be used to make bacteria in animals more sensitive to antibiotics.","The long-term goal of this research is to decrease the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in food production animals by administration of bacterial plasmid curing compounds. This project will characterize in vitro plasmid curing activity of menthol and SDS on a well-characterized set of carbapenemase- and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. It will also determine whether administration of SDS and menthol can cure R-plasmids from ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in mice.Specific objectives:1) Quantify plasmid loss under varying levels of plasmid curing agents (menthol and SDS), temperature (room temperature and mammalian and avian body temperature), and bacterial density (low and high).2) Co-culture R-plasmid carrying strains against R-plasmid cured counterparts to quantify differences in relative fitness.3) Colonize germ-free mice with R-plasmid carrying strains of Enterobacteriaceae and treat with plasmid curing agents (menthol and SDS).4) Quantify loss of R-plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae from mouse fecal pellets.5) Remove plasmid curing agents and monitor bacterial population dynamics to understand the longer-term effects of plasmid curing agents.","ESBL Enterobacteriaceae, R-plasmid, antibiotic resistance, plasmid curing"
PROJECT,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",1008011,2016-67011-24710,Weed management under global warming: biocontrol agent phenological mismatch,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,77386.0,"Keller, JO, A.",ACTIVE,"Effective weed management is an important part of productive farming. Some weeds are managed using insects that consume them. Often, the effectiveness of these insects depends on how synchronized they are with the weed that they target. If the insects are active too early or too late in the season relative to the weed that they target, they are less successful, and farmers either suffer lost productivity because there are more weeds on their land or spend more money managing weeds in other ways, such as by mowing or spraying with herbicide. Warmer temperatures are changing the seasonal timing of plant and animal activities. If beneficial insects and the weeds they consume have different responses to warming, the insects may become less effective, potentially costing farmers money. Musk thistle is one weed that is managed using insects. This weed causes large productivity losses in pastures, where sheep and cattle avoid its spiny leaves. This project aims to determine how rising temperatures will affect synchrony between musk thistle and one of the insects that is used to manage it, namely, the thistle head weevil.In order to accomplish this goal, we will conduct an outdoor experiment where we observe weevil activity on musk thistle at three different temperatures: ambient temperatures, mildly elevated temperatures achieved using fiberglass chambers, and more substantially elevated temperatures achieved using heaters. We will observe when musk thistle develops and when weevils are actively causing damage to musk thistle at each of these temperatures. We will also quantify how much damage the weevils cause to musk thistle at each of these temperatures. These measurements will allow us to predict how effective weevils will be at managing musk thistle as temperatures rise. We will use computer models to predict how changes in the timing of weevil activity will effect musk thistle population growth and also to investigate how mowing can be used to help efficiently manage musk thistle should the weevils become less effective. This information will assist farmers as they decide how to manage musk thistle in their pastures. Additionally, this experiment will help us to better understand how temperature influences seasonal interactions between plants and insects, which will be important in many other systems.",This project&#39;s first main goal is to advance the PD&#39;s development into an independent researcher.Supporting objectives for the first major goal include:1. To make use of state-of-the-art techniques to experimentally manipulate temperature in field experiments2. To continue to expand experimental design skills by taking courses in agroecology and integrated weed management3. To gain proficiency in key decision-making approaches for improved weed management by participating in a tutorial focused on population modeling4. To mentor promising undergraduate students through Penn State&#39;s Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) and Minority Undergraduate Research Experience (MURE) programs.5. To improve communication skills by publishing work in basic and applied peer-reviewed journals and presenting results at academic conferences6. Toconnect with farmers and landowners by presenting at Penn State&#39;s Ag Progress Days and leading a workshop on thistle management at the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture&#39;s Farming for the Future conference.The project&#39;s second main goal is to investigate the impact of climate change on seasonal synchrony between a weed and its biological control agent and to quantify changes in control efficacy resulting from changes in synchrony.Supporting objectives for the second main goal include:1. To measure temperature&#39;s effect on phenological synchrony between the model weed Carduus nutans and its biological control agent Rhinocyllus conicus in a field experiment2. To quantify changes in the efficacy of R. conicus as a control agent due to altered phenology3.

PROJECT,SAES - CORNELL UNIVERSITY,1008016,2016-67013-24414,Developing crop microbiomes for enhanced nitrogen utilization,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,456318.0,"Kao-Kniffin, JE.",ACTIVE,"Much of the United States agricultural system relies on breeding desirable traits that include high yield, disease suppression, and drought tolerance, among others. One of the constraints of relying on breeding techniques to improve crop traits is the issue of time. For most breeding programs, one selection cycle occurs annually, which means that we have only 35 breeding cycles until 2050--a critical global time point that centers on the question of how to feed over 9 billion people. It is unlikely that breeding alone will provide the solutions to increase yields for sustaining human population growth, while also responding to changes in climate. Our research project addresses this concern by initiating research that focuses on assembling collections of soil microbiota--bacteria, fungi, and viruses--that altogether, reinforce desirable crop traits. In essence, we are ""breeding"" groups of plant-associated microbiota that are able to enhance plant yield by enriching plant root zones with beneficial microorganisms. At present, many top agribusiness companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, Dupont, and BASF, are investing in microbial-based methods that influence crop traits. Industry is relying primarily on a single species or strain of microorganism as an inoculant in plant seeds or directly into soils. Our approach differs in that it includes complex communities of microorganisms that are assembled through repeated selections on the plant host trait, such as biomass or seed yield. The short lifecycle of bacteria and their ability to shift population structure rapidly, in response to selection, facilitates the breeding of soil microbiota for plant production systems.By 2050, the human population is expected to reach over 9 billion people, with the majority concentrated in Africa, Southern Asia, and Eastern Asia. For parts of these sections of the world, it is challenging to develop intensive agricultural systems routinely using industrial ammonia fertilizers to sustain high yields. Synthetic fertilizers (based on the Haber-Bosch process) consume high amounts of fossil fuel energy in their manufacture and contribute to chronic nonpoint source pollution in hotspots of agricultural production, such as found in the Salinas Valley area of California. Developing a plant microbiome focus to international crop production will help promote sustained yields in major parts of the world lacking the capacity for industrial-based agriculture, in addition to maintaining crop productivity in the U.S. Many cropping systems already include a focus on the microbiome for improved nutrient management; these include rhizobia for legumes and several arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for cereal crops. However, plants that do not form associations with symbionts rely heavily on fertilizer additions. Brassica crop production (many cultivars of which serve as the green vegetable staple of many populations in developing countries) would benefit heavily from greater nitrogen management via soil biotic manipulations, and serve as a model for additional crops that do not form symbiotic relationships.The proposed research will include sequencing of the microbiomes in an effort to identify who comprises the microbiomes that are associated with an enhanced seed yield phenotype and corresponding high nitrogen capture traits. We will be using 16S and 18S bar-coded paired-end reads for characterization of the soil microbiome using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequencing methods will allow us to assess how the microbiomes change in community composition over generations of selection, in relation to the development of higher seed yield in the host plants. Functional analysis using plant RNA-Seq, soil extracellular enzyme activity, plant tissue 15N enrichment, and nitrogen mineralization will help explain how the microbiomes are modifying plant phenotypes via plant gene expression and coordinated resource gain. These fundamental investigations into the interactions of plants and their associated microbiota will help pave the way for microbiome-enhancement of agricultural production systems.",Our goals are to: 1) Characterize the assemblages of microbial communities over generations of selection for enhanced nitrogen use efficiency of plants; 2) experimentally test the ability of the selected microbiomes to increase nitrogen use efficiency across different types of plants and soils; and 3) examine how microbiomes alter plant functioning and the potential mechanisms of how microbiomes influence plant nitrogen use efficiency.,"isotopes, microbiome, nitrogen, nutrient use, nutrient use efficiency, transcriptome"
PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,1008035,2016-67012-24705,An Integrated Approach to Increasing Farmers Market Use among Lower Income African American Families,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,148051.0,"Singleton, CH, RE.",ACTIVE,"Disparities in healthy food access persist in the US that disproportionally affect low-income and minority communities. Direct farm-to-consumer retail outlets such as farmers markets have been proposed as a strategy to improved healthy food access, nutrition and health in low-income communities. Despite the development of USDA-sponsored food assistance programs that incentivize use of farmers markets by low-income families, studies have observed lower rates of usage among low-income African Americans. Additionally, these studies have found that lack of awareness is a major barrier to farmers market usage. The overarching goal of this integrated project is to combine research and extension to develop a mechanism to increase farmers market use among low-income African American families. We aim to accomplish the following: 1) Assess awareness, attitudes and perceptions of farmers market use among low-income African American families 2) Determine if market nutrition environment affects usage by auditing local farmers markets in African American communities 3) Work alongside community stakeholders to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally-tailored nutrition education program designed to increase usage of farmers markets among low-income African American families. This integrated project addresses the AFRI FY 2015 Foundational Area of Food Safety, Nutrition and Health and Challenge Area of Childhood Obesity Prevention because it aims to positively influence the diet-related behaviors of low-income African American families. This project is relevant to the goals of the AFRI ELI Fellowships Grants Program because it will develop the program director&#39;s capacity to develop and deliver research-based extension programs.","Inadequate availability of healthy food in lower income communities across the US is a major public health and social justice issue. Studies have shown that disparities in food environment persist with several lower income and minority communities having reduced access to grocery stores and increased access to outlets that retail unhealthy, calorie-dense foods such as convenience stores and fast food restaurants. Poor access to affordable healthy food has been widely hypothesized to be associated with public health concerns such as food insecurity and obesity. Growing concern for these adverse nutrition outcomes has led to the review of national strategies to address food environment disparities. Retail outlets that support the distribution of locally grown food through direct farm-to-consumer sales (i.e. farmers markets, farm/roadside stands, community gardens, urban farms) have been proposed by researchers, policy makers and health agencies as a strategy to increase access to healthy food in the US. Today, farmers markets persist as the most popular and widely used farm-to-consumer outlet in communities across the US. Increasing the availability of farmers markets may alter the diet and diet-related behaviors of individuals residing in communities with limited access to healthy food. Although the total amount of farmers markets has increased substantially in the past decade, studies have reported the amount of lower income African Americans that utilize these outlets to purchase healthy food is low despite the existence of USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs that promote the use of farmers markets. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a mechanism to increase farmers market use among low-income African American families. We are proposing to take an integrated approach that combines research and extension to examine the barriers and facilitators of farmers market use among lower income African American families and develop and test the feasibility of a culturally-tailored nutrition education program designed to increase use of farmers markets among lower income African American families living in an urban setting. This project proposes to accomplish the following objectives:1.) Examine awareness, attitudes and perception of farmers market use among lower income SNAP eligible African American adults with at least one child less than 18 years old.2.) Examine relationships between neighborhood demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. % African American, median income) and the nutrition environment of local farmers markets.3.) Design, implement and test the feasibility of a community-based nutrition education program aimed to increase usage of farmers markets among lower income African American families.","african american, awareness, farmers market, low-income, urban"

Numerous evidences exist for promoting increased consumption of brown rice and dry beans for chronic disease prevention , yet prospective evaluation of health outcomes remains difficult due to lack of reliable dietary intake biomarkers. Our completed, short-term feeding studies with fixed amounts of rice bran and navy beans in children with elevated cholesterol and adult colorectal cancer survivors provide a novel opportunity for assessing dietary biomarkers of intake. Rice and beans merit biomarkers for nutritional assessment without reliance on self-reported intakes for whole grains and legumes during nutrition assessments as wheat, barley, rye and soybeans have been studied in dietary patterns and for relationships with disease risk. A major challenge with validating dietary biomarkers is that an elevated level of consumption is often required for reliable quantification, and emerging evidence supports that the overall dietary pattern (e.g. vegetarian, omnivore) can influence the profile of metabolites detected. The identification and validation of dietary biomarkers using metabolomics is an emerging field of investigation with broad-spectrum applications of health importance, and is the major focus of the research strategy for developing rice bran and navy bean biomarkers in children and adults herein. These studies will set the foundation for evaluating Rice Bran (RB) and Navy Beans (NB) intake to other important diet-disease relationships.","Our team identified metabolite profile distinctions across varieties of &#39;cooked&#39; whole grain rice, rice bran, and dry beans, that will help us identify related metabolic byproducts in humans. Moreover, our scientific knowledge of changes in liver gene expression and microbiota in response to elevated bean consumption from our animal studies also provided key insights into food metabolism that influences biomarker identification and detection.Aim 1: The control meals/snacks will yield profiles for common foods (e.g. fatty acids, specific amino acids) that are not specific to Rice Bran (RB) and Navy Beans (NB), and will provide a strong comparison for evaluating which RB or NB constituents add or replace small molecules detected in control meals and snacks.Aim 2: Blood, urine and stool metabolomes from BENEFIT (Beans/Bran Enriching Nutritional Eating For Intestinal health Trial) participants will reveal candidate dietary biomarker profiles specific for RB or NB intake.Aim 3: Blood plasma metabolomes of children that completed the one-month dietary intervention study will reveal candidate dietary biomarker exposure profiles for RB or NB intake.","dietary biomarkers, dry bean, metabolome, rice bran"
PROJECT,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,1007506,2016-67021-24456,Study of Ammonia and Methane Emissions from Animal Feeding Operations using Unmanned Aerial System Laser Sensors,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,494062.0,"Yalin, AZ.",ACTIVE,"US agriculture emits 3.5 Tg of ammonia per year through fertilizer application and livestock waste. These ammonia emissions have important impacts on air quality and ecosystems downwind of the sources. Ammonia may contribute to airborne fine particulate matter, which can adversely affect health, visibility and climate, while deposition of ammonia and ammonium to soils can change plant growth charateristics.The proposed project will use laser sensors deployed on small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) to measure ammonia and methane emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and to quantify ammonia deposition downwind of CAFOs. Key innovations of the emissions monitoring system include: 1) simultaneous ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) detection using open-path cavity ring-own spectroscopy, 2) sUAS flight capabilities that are more nimble, safer and more cost effective to operate than manned aircraft, and 3) inversion and flux modeling to infer sources, fluxes, and ammonia deposition. In addition to providing an improved means to quantify amonia emissions and deposition, we will seek to identify new best practices to mitigate their negative effects, for example, planting crops downwind of sites to increase local ammonia deposition and reduce deposition at further locations. The methane measurements will provide source fluxes to quantify the carbon footprint of CAFOs. More broadly, the project will also demonstrate the possibility of certifying and flying sUAS at agricultural sites which can also be useful for crop, soil, and canopy imaging, as well as animal health monitoring and other applications.","The main goal of this project is to develop new technology that uses UAS-mounted open path laser sensors for measuring CAFO-scale NH3 emissions and local N deposition while also yielding farm scale CH4 fluxes. The technology will greatly improve our ability to judge the potential for long distance transport of fugitive NH3 from livestock and the carbon footprint of beef production.The main objectives of the proposed project are:Develop lightweight open-path laser sensor for ammonia and methane and integrate to an sUAS.Obtain needed certification from the FAA to operate the sUAS at a cooperator site in eastern Colorado.Perform flight campaigns to quantify local N deposition using the downwind change in NH3:CH4 ratio, and measure methane and ammonia emissions from the site, supported by ground (tower) measurements.Perform additional measurements from the ground (tower) and mobile vehicles both during and between the UAS campaigns to provide better temporal coverage and determine if N deposition can be accurately measured without the need for sUAS.Use numeric models to infer sources and to quantify the ammonia deposition in the downwind shadow of the site.Use these findings to infer how management of crops and vegetation downwind of beef feedlots could maximize N deposition and become part of a best management plan for mitigating impacts of emissions.","ammonia, deposition, emissions, methane, sensors, unmanned aerial system, unmanned aerial vehicle"

This project will improve system efficiency and economic sustainability and is intended to encompass field machinery, transportation to storage, and storage, which is relevant to the Agricultural Systems and Technology program area. Field conditions and equipment performance, as a function of moisture, will be integrated with geospatial parameters to achieve site specific recommendations.The trend of ""big data"" in agriculture will continue to produce enormous amounts of data that are often underutilized. This project will apply data to develop and validate a model that will enable grain producers to make informed, information driven decisions relevant to harvest timing. Additionally, producers will be able to evaluate changes in infrastructure, utilization, and equipment ratios against potential losses due to timeliness.Data logged from the CAN-bus on field equipment, logistic data from transportation vehicles, and data logged from the grain dryer and storage facility will be used to define equipment performance and interactions. Field studies will be utilized to define losses from modern equipment and hybrids as a function of grain moisture over multiple crops in a three year period at a commercial farm.The proposed work differs from previous research in its scope, site specific recommendations, and the quantity of data that will be used to inform the model.

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS,1007652,2016-67017-24425,Novel Methods for Bacterial Isolation from Food and Agricultural Matrices,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,473380.0,"Nugen, SA, R.",ACTIVE,"A pragmatic and efficient means of bacterial separation/concentration remains the bottleneck forrapid pathogen detection in food and agriculture. We are investigating a two-step process inisolating bacteria from a food and agricultural samples. The first step separates surface-adheredbacterial from a plant-based matrix. This is accomplished using a customized enzymaticdigestion of the plant material. As the plant material is rapidly broken down, the bacterial cells inand on the matrix surface are released into an aqueous mixture. While the digestion has beenshown to rapidly liquefy the plant matrix, there has been no effect on the viability of the bacterialcells. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant increase in bacterial recovery followingenzymatic digestion.The second step involves the removal of the bacteria from the liquefied sample. This will beaccomplished using high affinity bacteriophage-tagged magnetic particles. The coliphage T7 andthe Listeria spp. specific phage A511 will be genetically modified to allow for biotin expressionon the major capsid proteins. The result will be oriented conjugation of the phages ontostreptavidin-coated magnetic particles. This phage separation strategy has been shown to havehigher capture efficiencies as compared to immuno-affinity based separation. Once separated,the bacteria will be quantified using QPCR.A validation of the proposed separation method will be performed by extension. E. coliinoculated spinach and Listeria inoculated bean sprouts will be enzymatically digested and thenundergo a phage-based magnetic separation.","The food and agriculture industry would benefit greatly from a rapid screening method to determine the presence of potential pathogens in complex matrices. Unfortunately, a pragmatic and efficient means of bacterial separation remains the bottleneck for rapid pathogen detection. Without an effective separation method, the need to rapidly screen for pathogens on sensitive agricultural samples will go unmet. The current method of pre-enriching bacteria prior to separation and detection requires extended periods of time and may not be suitable to environments such as food production facilities. Additionally, there exists a need to separate bacteria in a manner which will facilitate both enumeration and identification. Once a product has been pre-enriched, the ability to enumerate the initial sample load becomes difficult. There is a fundamental need to develop next generation technologies which will enable the rapid and efficient separation and concentration of bacteria, thus improving abilities for early detection. The lack of reliable, robust and rapid separation methods is the current roadblock to rapid detection. Improvements in these methods would enable many rapid and sensitive detection technologies which require concentrated and clean samples. We propose a rapid bacterial separation method using a combination of enzymatic matrix digestion and phage-based separation which will allow the use of rapid detection methods on agricultural matrices.The overall goal of this hypothesis-driven research is to enable early detection methods by rapidly and efficiently separating and concentrating bacteria from agricultural matrices. We hypothesize that a bacterial separation method which 1) breaks down the sample matrix allowing removal internalized bacteria, and 2) magnetically concentrates bacteria by utilizing the irreversible binding bacteriophages will allow an improvement early detection and therefore food safety (Figure1). We further hypothesize that the use of phages for the separation and lysis of the bacteria will allow the determination of viability when followed with PCR. To accomplish this goal, we propose an interdisciplinary approach encompassing expertise in the fields of molecular biology, enzymology, materials engineering, and food microbiology, as outlined below.Specific Objectives:Enzymatic digestion of food and agricultural products for bacterial release and separationPhage enabled separation of E. coli and Listeria spp. from liquid samples Validation of a digestion/phage-based bacterial separation method on food matrices","Enzymatic digestion, Sample concentration, rapid detection, sample preparation"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,1007688,2016-67016-24866,Investigating the Mechanisms by which Heat Stress Induces Hypophagia and Hypogalactia,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,485000.0,"Renquist, BE, JE.",ACTIVE,"Heat Stress decreases the profitability of U.S. animal agriculture by approximately $2.4 billion/year. Strategies to limit the production losses associated with heat exposureare largely limited to intensive production systems and highly dependent on water and electricity. With the increased pressure on water supplies throughout the western United States it is essential to find water and energy independent alternatives to limit production losses to heat stress. This grant focuses on the hypothesis that the increased histamine synthesis that accompanies heat stress depresses food intake, milk production, and mammary development. 3 specific aims have been designed to identify pharmacological targets to mitigate production losses common to heat exposure. In objective 1,we aim to identify the histamine signaling pathway that depresses food intake during heat stress. In objective 2, we aim toindentify the histamine signaling pathway that decreases milk production during heat stress. In objective 3, we aim to isolate the signals that mute mammary development during heat stress. We expect that these studies will identify pharmacological targets to prevent the decreased food intake and milk production during heat stress. Accordingly, we believe that a pharmacological treatment arising from this research couldimprove profitability of U.S. animal agriculture while simultaneously limiting the need for energy and water intensive cooling strategies that are currently employed to maintain animal production when temperatures rise. ","Aim 1: Identify the histamine signaling pathway that induces heat stress hypophagia. The suppression of feed intake in response to heat stress is dependent on central nervous system histamine signaling. Histamine stimulates arginine vasopressin (AVP) through H1 receptors and encourages norepinephrine (NE) mediated vasoconstriction of the visceral vasculature through H2. We propose to individually antagonize the H1 and H2 receptors to identify the mechanism by which histamine mediates heat stress hypophagia and hyperdipsia. Additional studies in the mouse will focus on pharmacological manipulation downstream of these receptors at AVP and &alpha;-adrenergic receptors. Upon isolating the receptors and neurotransmitters through which heat stress induces hypophagia in the mouse, we will conduct studies focused on pharmacological inhibition of hypophagia in the cow. We expect these studies to pharmacologically distinguish the hypophagia and hyperdipsia of heat stress, with the goal to pharmacologically restore phagic drive while encouraging water intake.Aim 2: Identify the hormones that induce short-term hypogalactia in response to heat exposure. Only 40% of the immediate decrease in milk production is explained by hypophagia. Thus 60% of the hypogalactia can be alleviated without reversing hypophagia. In this aim, we will identify the mechanism by which heat stress induces a short-term depression of milk production. Specifically, we propose that the short-term hypogalactia of heat stress is a response to decreases in mammary blood flow, which arises as a result of central nervous system histamine signaling that drives vasoconstriction by enhancing sympathetic tone. Studies in the lactating mouse are designed to first test if hypogalactia is histamine dependent, then identify the histamine receptors involved in this pathway, and finally address the role of AVP and NE. We hypothesize that the decrease in milk production is dependent on histamine induced increases in adrenergic tone and signaling at &alpha;1-adrenoreceptors. We will conduct studies in the cow to confirm that this mechanism is conserved in the cow, while identifying pharmaceutical targets to prevent heat stress hypogalactia.Aim 3: Identify the signals that mediate heat stress depression of mammary development. Heat stress prior to parturition or early in lactation decreases mammary development resulting in hypogalactia that persists throughout lactation. We will test two possible mechanisms by which heat stress inhibits mammary development. First, heat stress increases hepatic &beta;-OH butyrate production and mammary gland &beta;-OH butyrate clearance. &Beta;-OH butyrate suppresses mitotic mammary gland development. We have developed a model that lacks hepatic &beta;-OH butyrate production and will allow us to isolate the role of this metabolite in mammary development. Second, by enhancing adrenergic tone, heat stress decreases mammary gland blood flow. We will chronically block the heat stress induced mammary artery vasoconstriction by antagonizing &alpha;1-adrenoreceptors to assess the effect of mammary blood flow on mammary development.Impact: These studies aim to identify pharmacological targets to limit production losses from heat stress. Given the large economic burden of heat stress, the expected increase in mean global temperatures, and water shortages in the Western U.S., it is imperative that we develop less water and energy intensive methods to mitigate production losses due to heat exposure.","Beta-OH Butyrate, Feed intake, Heat stress, Lactation, feed intake, heat stress, lactation"

However, after decades of research, the effects of omega-3 PUFAs remain controversial, making it difficult to make dietary recommendations of omega-3 PUFAs for cancer prevention. Therefore, it is of critical importance to better understand the mechanisms behind the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 PUFAs to optimize their use and benefit in a larger population.Here in this proposal we will investigate the mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs inhibit colon cancer. We will test the hypothesis that omega-3 PUFAs suppress colon cancer progression in part via induction of anti-tumor immune responses and changes in the colon lipid composition. Our preliminary data showed that dietary supplementation of high-purity omega-3 PUFAs dramatically increased anti-tumor immune cells in tumor tissues. Here we will extend our discovery to investigate the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on colon cancer and associated inflammation and immune responses. Using a unique LC-MS/MS lipidomics platform, our preliminary data also showed that lipid metabolites in both the blood and tumor are profoundly altered by the omega-3 vs. omega-6 diets. In this proposal we will use LC-MS/MS to determine the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on profiles of lipid metabolites in tissues, and use transgenic animal models to elucidate the specific pathways and metabolites involved in the effects of omega-3 PUFAs.","The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of &omega;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in order to optimize their use for disease prevention.

Here we will test our hypotheses: (1) &omega;-3 PUFAs suppress colon carcinogenesis in part through induction of anti-cancer immune responses, and (2) the anti-cancer and immune-modulating effects of &omega;-3 PUFAs are in part mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived &omega;-3 lipid metabolites.

The outcomes of this project are to elucidate the specific immune cells and &omega;-3 lipid metabolites involved in the beneficial actions of &omega;-3 PUFAs, which could facilitate the effective implementation of &omega;-3 PUFAs for disease prevention.

Mechanical and friction behaviors, measured using rheological and tribological techniques, respectively, play a primary role in many textural attributes. A fundamental understanding of rheological (flow and deformation) and tribological (friction) behaviors is a key component in designing food products with appealing textures. Fundamental rheological and tribological behaviors include viscosity, viscoelastic, large-strain, and friction behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to support and increase fundamental rheological and tribological research of food products in the Food Rheology Laboratory at the University of Idaho by purchase of a DHR-2 Rheometer. The Food Rheology laboratory is currently equipped with two rheometers: a DHR-3 Rheometer and an AR-2000 rheometer. However, the AR-2000 is not functioning and the manufacturer no longer supports repair. The rheometers are key research instruments in the Food Rheology Laboratory and are used by students and faculty in the Food Science and Biosystems Engineering Departments at both the University of Idaho and Washington State University. Having only one functioning rheometer has resulted in a bottleneck for sample evaluation, and significantly slowed progress of rheological/tribological research. This bottleneck will worsen as the number of rheometer users increases. Purchase of a DHR-2 rheometer would alleviate this bottleneck, increasing research productivity.","Rheology, the study of flow and deformation of materials, has been used to evaluate food texture and mechanical properties for nearly a century. Tribology, the study of lubrication and wear between sliding surfaces, has only recently been used to evaluate food frictional properties but is rapidly gaining interest in food science studies. The rheological and tribological behaviors of foods have been used in combination to explain the links between the structure and texture of many different foods.The main research goal of studies in the Food Rheology Laboratory at the University of Idaho is to develop a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the effect of food structural features on food texture using rheological and tribological approaches. To that end, the main research instrument in this laboratory is the rheometer, which is capable of performing a wide variety of rheological measurements on solid, semi-solid, and fluid foods. Originally, the Food Rheology Laboratory contained two working rheometers: a DHR-3 and AR-2000, both manufactured by TA Instruments. However, the AR-2000 now has a damaged air bearing and repair of this 14-year-old instrument is no longer supported by TA Instruments. Since the air bearing is critical to the proper operation of the rheometer, it can no longer be used. As a result, there is currently one usable rheometer in the Food Rheology Laboratory. Although rigorous scheduling practices have allowed current research projects to remain on track, three graduate students will be starting research projects in the summer and fall of 2015 and additional projects are planned to start within the next year. There is a high probability that these projects will be delayed due to the availability of only one rheometer. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to purchase a DHR-2 rheometer with a starch pasting cell, torsional cell, and double-gap cup and bob system to alleviate the potential testing bottleneck and expand the research capabilities of the Food Rheology Laboratory.","equipment, food properties, rheology, tribology"

Imagery from aircraft and satellites is one of the most promising advances for covering the large and spatially heterogeneous expanse of the U.S. However, it has been challenging to successfully apply this imagery to estimating crop yield or forage production at the field scale for three main reasons. First, insufficient in situ data for satellite product validation can lead to low confidence in the estimated values from the imagery. Both imagery and ground-based estimates are needed at the appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions to account for heterogeneity in ecosystem response to weather and management. Second, insufficient availability of imagery and derived products can lead to the use of sensors at incorrect temporal or spatial resolutions for the questions being addressed. Third, insufficient on-site expertise can lead to the selection of inappropriate sensors or analyses, and the inability of researchers to keep up with new, relevant sensor technology. Although field-based estimates are useful for individual farmers and ranchers, a more integrated and coordinated spatial assessment is needed for complete coverage of the U.S. that includes scaling of these field-based estimates to broader spatial extents. A critical challenge when scaling beyond individual fields is to determine how to extrapolate field-based algorithms derived from imagery to the landscape, county, region, and country. This scaling needs to account for the spatial heterogeneity inherent in agro-ecosystems, land management, soils, and climate across the continent. It is also challenging to develop a coordinated scaling approach across the country for agro-ecosystems that differ in cover type (crop, range), production system, and management regime given that each sensor has its own spatial and temporal resolution suitable for use under different conditions. These challenges are not unique to U.S. agriculture, and there is much to be gained through international collaboration. We propose to address these challenges through a workshop that promotes discussion and collaboration among four groups of scientists from: (1) the U.S. Department of Agriculture Long Term Agro-ecosystem Research Network (LTAR), (2) the Global Earth Observation Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Program and, in particular scientists from their Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) sites, (3) the Calibration/Validation representatives from NASA, and (4) the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).Participation by scientists from nine LTAR sites provides an opportunity for a large suite of long-term in situ data to be available for the accuracy assessment to address the first challenge. The second challenge of image availability will be addressed through participation by NASA and by the international GEOGLAM members with their access to a large suite of optical and SAR (radar) imagery including those from the ESA Sentinel 1 and 2 missions (http://www.jecam.org/). The participation by remote sensing experts from across the country and globally will address the third challenge related to sensor and analysis expertise, and knowledge of new sensors such as SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar). The final challenges will be addressed through collaborations among professional expertise from nine LTAR sites distributed across the US to cover six Farm Resource Regions working with calibration/validation imagery experts from NASA and remote sensing experts from JECAM as well as our key stakeholder, USDA NASS. Scaling the field-based algorithms and developing a common scaling approach will require remote sensing experts, field-based experts, and landscape ecologists working collaboratively with NASS scientists involved in providing crop yield and production estimates as data services for the USDA (www.nass.usda.gov/research_and_science/). Our time during the workshop is designed to promote and enhance these interactions, and to provide sufficient time to work together on these problems as a way to contribute to improved estimates as part of a national strategy. Thus, each group brings a different set of strengths to the workshop.","Goals: (1) To design an accuracy assessment of satellite-based technologies using in situ measurements from multiple agro-ecosystems; (2) to develop a coordinated scaling approach across sites and agro-ecosystems to extrapolate field-based algorithms that will contribute to improved estimates and characterizations of broader scale patterns in yield and production in the context of a national strategy for sustainable crop and livestock production.The specific objectives of the workshop are: (1) To compare the performance of satellite-based sensors for estimating measures that contribute to in situ yield and production in different agro-ecosystems; satellites and sensors will be selected with different spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, VIIRS, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite [GOES]).(2) To evaluate emerging satellite-based and in situ sensors for estimating yield and production in different agro-ecosystems (e.g., SMAP, SAR, Unmanned aerial vehicles).(3) To determine how well field-based algorithms can be scaled to the landscape, county, region, and country.(4) To promote collaborations among scientists in the Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network with researchers in the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) network under the Global Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Initiative (GEOGLAM).(5) To develop recommendations to the USDA that will contribute to a national strategy for sustainable crop and livestock production in the U.S. through improved estimates of production and yield on croplands and rangelands using Earth observations.","production, remote sensing; imagery; in situ measurements; validation; scaling; crop yield"

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT RIVERSIDE,1008838,2016-67013-24815,Nutrient uptake and utilization strategies of oomycete pathogens during biotrophic and necrotrophic growth,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Judelson, HO.",ACTIVE,"The ability of microbes to acquire host nutrients is at the core of pathogenesis. Colonization relies at least as much on a pathogen&#39;s capacity to reproduce using host biosubstances as on overcoming host defenses. Little is known about how pathogens perceive and obtain nutrients, and how metabolism varies between infection styles. This proposal addresses these issues in two members of the taxonomic group known as oomycetes, namely Phytophthora infestans (potato late blight) and the Pythium ultimum (potato leak). Both cause important diseases on plants, including on the same host, potato tubers. However, the two species employ different strategies: P. infestans causes little host damage until the late stages of infection, and is believed to take up nutrients using special organs known as haustoria, while Py. ultimum is believed to obtain nutrients by killing the cells of the host plant, and then absorbing the nutrients that are released.Our work will focus on two aspects of nutrition: how nutrients are acquired by P. infestans and Py. ultimum during plant infection, and how the nutrients such as sugars, nitrate, and amino acids are metabolized by those species. The work will be interdisciplinary and will employ the tools of cell biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and biochemistry. The research will test concepts in plant-oomycete interactions that are based largely on dogma, such as that oomycete haustoria are enriched for transporters and that P. infestans kills the cells of its host late in disease. It will also lead to innovative approaches for protecting plants from biotic stress by identifying pathways in the pathogen that may be targets for agrochemicals or plant-based solutions.","This project addresses the most fundamental aspect of microbe-plant interactions: the acquisition and use of host nutrients by pathogens. To reproduce, pathogens must feed on their hosts. Colonization thus depends as much on a pathogen&#39;s ability to obtain and metabolize host nutrients as on its capacity to overcome host defenses. Host nutrients also influence progression through the pathogen&#39;s life cycle, regulate the expression of pathogenicity factors, and affect host range. A logical hypothesis is that many pathogens use infection-induced transporters and/or structures such as haustoria to acquire host nutrients. It is also logical to hypothesize that pathogen metabolism changes during its life and disease cycles to adapt to changing levels of host nutrients, or to shift to saprotrophy. Another hypothesis is that biotrophs and necrotrophs use distinct strategies to address their nutritional needs. To address these issues, this project will determine the subcellular location of infection-specific P. infestans transporters and metabolic enzymes, and test their function. The project will also compare the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes and transporters in P. infestans, a hemibiotroph, with Pythium ultimum, a necrotroph. This will test the hypothesis that the nutritional strategies of necrotrophs and biotrophs differ.","biochemistry, metabolism, oomycete, pathogenesis, haustoria"

More than 11 million children five and under spend an average of 30 hours a week in non-parental care, with children of working mothers spending almost 40 hours a week in such care. Since most children five or under (60%) spend a considerable amount of time in care outside the home, ECE settings are an optimal place to reach large numbers of young children.Obesity prevention policy, systems and practice initiatives impacting ECE settings focus on ensuring food served is healthy, consumption of sugar sweetened beverages is limited, opportunities are provided each day for children to be physical active (including reducing the amount of time spent in front of a screen) and staff encouragement of breastfeeding. Nationwide, state stakeholder groups are identifying and leveraging opportunities to prevent childhood obesity through the ECE setting. Evaluations of efforts to ensure ECE settings are meeting best practices for healthy eating, physical activity, screen time, and breastfeeding support have found promising results. A systematic review of such evaluations found moderate evidence suggesting that multi-component obesity prevention approaches implemented in ECE settings improve weight related outcomes in preschoolers.The 2009 Healthy Kids, Healthy Future conference was intended to meet an identified need in the field at the time: a multi-disciplinary approach to child health promotion and obesity prevention.

The main focus of the conference is disseminating early childhood obesity prevention science-based knowledge to leading experts for the purpose of informing program planning and future research. The conference will foster scientific exchange by bringing together experts in research, practice and policy from disciplines including nutrition, health, physical activity, obesity prevention, early care and education, and parent/family engagement. Their combined expertise and research experience will inform future research, policy and practice to enhance the quality of life beginning in the earliest stages of life.Given contextual factors in ECE and child health now is a critical time to come together as a field and discuss how we can capitalize on opportunities in the current landscape. The overarching goal of the proposed conference is to serve as a forum focused on the intersection of ECE and child health, through which national experts in research, practice and policy can build relationships to accelerate work toward reduction of childhood obesity. The conference will also build important relationships and create efficiencies for moving shared work forward. The vision for the conference is an event that focuses on:Joining research, policy, and practice in ECE and child health;Continuing important discussions about health promotion and obesity prevention in ECE environments;Engaging thought leaders and policy makers at the local, state and national levels about systems level changes that can accelerate impact and sustain progress;Increasing understanding of existing innovative programs and initiatives (what works and why);Spreading, Scaling &amp; Sustaining ""promising practices"" in health promotion and obesity prevention; andCommitting to actions that can further advance the field.","Goal and Objectives:The overarching goal of the proposed conference is to serve as a forum focused on the intersection of ECE and child health, through which national experts in research, practice and policy can build relationships to accelerate work toward reduction of childhood obesity.The conference will also build important relationships and create efficiencies for moving shared work forward.Conference objectives are:To reflect on accomplishments in the field since the 2009 convening,To identify opportunities to build upon and leverage existing work, andTo determine collective next stepsOur vision for the conference is an event that focuses on:Joining research, policy, and practice in ECE and child health;Continuing important discussions about health promotion and obesity prevention in ECE environments;Engaging thought leaders and policy makers at the local, state and national levels about systems level changes that can accelerate impact and sustain progress;Increasing understanding of existing innovative programs and initiatives (what works and why);Spreading, Scaling &amp; Sustaining ""promising practices"" in health promotion and obesity prevention; andCommitting to actions that can further advance the field.Our goals for the conference are for attendees to leave with: 1) a shared re-commitment to ECE as a space for childhood obesity prevention, and 2) confidence and clarity related to actions they can/should take related to practice, policy, and/or research within their constituency groups and networks in order to facilitate progress on childhood obesity prevention.","child nutrition, childhood obesity prevention, conference, health promotion, wellness"
PROJECT,"UNIVERSITY OF IOWA, THE",1008857,2016-67015-24917,Determining the role of Marek`s disease virus UL13 protein kinase in horizontal transmission,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499838.0,"Jarosinski, KE, W.",ACTIVE,"Marek&#39;s disease (MD) is a devastating disease in the poultry industry caused by a cancer causing herpesvirus called MD virus (MDV). The estimated economic impact of MD is $US1-2 billion annually. MD is characterized by suppression of the immune system making the chicken more susceptible to other pathogens; neurological symptoms including paralysis; and tumors throughout the body that ultimately lead to death of the chicken. Despite regular immunizations, MDV can still infect vaccinated chickens because current vaccines do not prevent infection with disease-causing viruses in the chicken house. A major reason for the failure of current vaccines to stop these infections is because these vaccines do not prevent spread from chicken-to-chicken, termed horizontal transmission. A major obstacle in designing new vaccines that could prevent horizontal transmission is the lack of information on viral genes important for this step. We have identified specific MDV genes that are essential for transmission of MDV, namely the UL13 protein kinase and glycoprotein C (gC). The long term goal of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of horizontal transmission of MDV and utilize this knowledge for the development of vaccines and control measures that reduce superinfection of immunized birds. The specific objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the UL13 protein kinase functions during horizontal transmission of MDV. We surmise that UL13&#39;s role in transmission is through its kinase activity that we hypothesize affects signaling pathways in the feathers and skin of chickens, from which the virus is disseminated into the environment. We will determine the stage(s) at which UL13 is essential for horizontal transmission and identify molecular signaling pathways activated or modified by UL13 kinase activity in the skin and feathers required for transmission. Information obtained from this proposal will yield valuable information when designing the next generation of MDV vaccine viruses that could prevent the spread of virulent virus.","This project addresses an important aspect of Marek&#39;s disease and control measures against Marek&#39;s disease through the use of vaccines. The overall goal is to obtain information as to the role the conserved herpesviral protein kinase, UL13, plays in transmission. Currently, we know that this protein kinase is essential for transmission of Marek&#39;s disease virus (MDV) from chicken-to-chicken, but how it facilitates this is not known. We plan to identify specific viral and cellular targets that UL13 phosphorylates both in vitro and in vivo. This will allow us to target these genes or genetic pathways in order to block transmission of MDV. Our overall goal will be addressed in two major objectives:Objective 1: Determine the stage(s) at which transmission of UL13 mutant rMDVs are impaired. The overall objective here is to determine the stage(s) that transmission-deficient UL13 mutant viruses are defective. That is, is the virus defective at formation of infectious virus in the feather follicle epithelial (FFE) cells from which virus should develop, or is infectious virus produced, but unable to initiate infection in the new host. We hypothesize that the defect in transmission of UL13 mutants is caused by an inability of MDV to fully assemble and generate cell-free virus (CFV) in the FFE cells. A refined model of virus transmission involving extraction of CFV and administration of CFV via different routes of host entry will be employed. Specific objectives include:Whether infectious virus is produced in the skin of chickens infected with transmission-deficient viruses?Whether the route of entry of virus produced in FFE cells is important for infection of chickens with UL13 mutant viruses.At what stage(s) is UL13 important for transmission?Is UL13 important for CFV infectivity at the point of infection or replication?Does the minute CFV infection isolated from chickens infected with vUL13K170M result from natural reversion?Is there a defect in virus ultrastructure or assembly in cells infected with UL13 mutant viruses compared to wild-type?Objective 2: Determine the UL13-mediated molecular pathways required for transmission. We hypothesize that UL13 kinase activity plays a specific role during replication in FFE cells targeting specific cellular and/or viral substrates that facilitate efficient virus assembly in this tissue. To do this, wild-type and mutant UL13 expression constructs and mutant virues will be used for in vitro and in situ studies in order to identify potential UL13 kinase targets using mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphopeptide analyses coupled with pathway analyses. Validation of potential substrates and pathways will be confirmed using western blot and in vitro kinase assays. Specific objectives include:Which cellular and viral proteins are phosphorylated during in vitro and in situ replication?What specific cellular and viral proteins are differentially phosphorylated during in vitro and in situ replication?What molecular signaling pathways does MDV UL13 potentially modify during replication in FFE cells where it is required for transmission?","Marek`s disease, chickens, herpesvirus, protein kinase, proteomics, transmission, vaccine"
PROJECT,SAES - SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008871,2016-68004-24768,Back to the Future: Enhancing food security and farm production with integrated crop-livestock production systems,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,2382840.0,"Kumar, SA.",ACTIVE,"Project Title: Back to the Future: Enhancing food security and farm production with integrated crop-livestock production systems.Rational: Diversifying production on marginally-productive croplands could contribute to increased crop production and can feed the increased global population and enhance food security. Introducing livestock into annual and perennial farming systems can improve crop productivity, various ecosystem services and provide economic benefits. This USDA-CAP grant will address the Agricultural Production Systems of Food Security Program Area and focus on promoting the integrated crop and livestock (ICL) management systems for mitigating food security and maintaining environmental quality in the Northern Great Plain. Ruminant livestock have traditionally grazed the Great Plains grasslands but this region has been losing grassland to cropland, subsequently impacting various ecosystems services. A variety of livestock forage resources are available within annual cropping systems that can be used to replace forage lost through land conversion. Research studies that involve livestock performance, grazing cover crops and perennials have been conducted in various settings in the U.S and suggested generalized solutions. However, to implement these strategies on farms throughout the Great Plains requires further work to develop recommendations to producers considering changes in their cropping systems. Gathering information from existing long-term studies in the Northern Great Plains and transferring this knowledge to producers will help promote more diverse farming practices and improve food security. Through this CAP there is an opportunity to involve farmers in the process of addressing food security by diversifying production and increasing ecosystem services.Hypoth?esis: We hypothesize that an integrated crop-livestock system will alter nutrient cycling and improve soil resilience by altering the microbial community, the soil structure and other soil properties, and improve crop production and the environment.Project Objectives: The overall goal of this multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary project is to understand and increase the adaptability among researchers and various age group farmers by using ICL systems within the Northern Great Plains region. While our engagement of current producers will increase the awareness and encouragement towards adopting ICL systems, a major impact of this project will come in the future through our education and outreach efforts with students, landowners and producers in the region. The project objectives are to use long-term data and generate additional data on soils, crop performance and environmental parameters to evaluate the impacts of ICL systems on sustainable production and share this information with the larger audiences. Further, this project will explore management practices and their risks and stability in the implementation of resilient cropping systems. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students and the next generation of scientists in the area of soils, environment, pathology, microbiology, animal health, sociology and extension.Expected Results: The benefits of ICL systems will be disseminated to producers and stakeholders for adoption of new alternative systems to improve food security. The project will identify optimized ICL practices and educating the farming community through extension and training activities. This CAP project will allow us to: (i) continue to collect data regarding crop and livestock production, soil and water quality, and greenhouse gases on existing large- and small-scale field trials of ICL systems; (ii) identify key barriers that inhibit farmers from using integrated systems; (iii) develop opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in this important field; (iv) conduct economic analyses of our proposed processes; (v) understanding trade-offs will allow producers to make informed decisions on management selection that include long-term environmental impacts. The graduate and undergraduate students and researchers will be trained about sustainable ICL systems and various land and field sampling techniques.?Anticipated Impacts: Project impacts include an improved understanding about ICL systems to various professionals including producers, high school students and researchers. This project will help the producers to: (i) understand the socio-economic factors associated with adopting ICL systems, (ii) improve the knowledge about the benefits and consequences of ICL systems, (iii) understand the economics of different types of ICL systems to aid in selecting the &#39;best-fit&#39;, (iv) improve the knowledge from results gathered from focus groups to inform survey and educational/outreach activities, and (v) improve the understanding of the life cycle analysis of an ICL system, and environmental impacts associated with this system. Publications will be submitted to disseminate information as broadly as possible and increase national and international awareness of ICL systems. Educational materials will be developed by agricultural education experts and will be disseminated directly to teachers in the region. This information will be given to future landowners, producers, and other potential stakeholders before their practices are established, thus enabling recommended production practices to be incorporated appropriately across the landscape.","The overall goal of this multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary project is to understand and increase the adaptability among researchers and various age group farmers by using ICL systems within the Northern Great Plains region.

PROJECT,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008876,2016-67016-24947,Vaccine for the prevention of necrotic enteritis in poultry,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Roland, KE.",ACTIVE,"One element of traditional commercial poultry rearing is the addition of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics in the feed to promote growth. Due to concerns that this practice contributes to an increase in antibiotic resistant human bacterial pathogens, there is a movement in the US to reduce or eliminate all use of antibiotics in the food chain. Based on experiences in Europe and Scandinavia, one negative outcome of eliminating antibiotic use in poultry is an increase in the incidence of necrotic enteritis caused by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Birds with necrotic enteritis display a range of symptoms. Subclinical infections result in decreased digestion and adsorption of food, while more severe, clinical infections lead to a variety of symptoms including severe depression, decreased appetite, reluctance to move, diarrhea and ruffled feathers, often leading to death.Fortunately, as an alternative to antibiotics, necrotic enteritis can be prevented by vaccination. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, highly efficacious necrotic enteritis vaccine. We will use novel attenuated (i.e. genetically modified to be incapable of causing disease) Salmonella strains to deliver multiple protective C. perfringens antigens. Use of Salmonella for antigen delivery will allow for cost-effective, mass vaccination by coarse spray or in water. As an added safety feature, the Salmonella strain used is designed to ""self-destruct"" once it has accomplished its objective of inducing a protective immunity against C. perfringens. In addition, we anticipate that birds vaccinated with this necrotic enteritis vaccine will also be immunized against the human pathogen Salmonella, adding an increased level of safety for the consumer.","Our major goal is to develop a vaccine that can be applied in water or by coarse spray, to protect broiler birds against necrotic enteritis. The approach involves the use of novel, attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strains for antigen delivery, thereby providing immunity against Salmonella as well.WWe will be using a novel S.

Relevant phenotypes include lysis in the absence of arabinose and diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and mannose-dependent O-antigen synthesis. In the vaccine (c11802 + C. perfringens antigens), the DAP requirement is complemented by addition of an AsdA+ antigen-encoding plasmid, but the arabinose requirement is not complemented, leading to lysis of the vaccine in vivo.ObjectivesIdentify and clone new C. perfringens antigens, in addition to the ones we have already cloned. Leading candidates include fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase (FBA), a hypothetical protein, HP, with proven efficacy, fimbriae and/or adhesins, and peptides derived from the large clostridial toxin, TpeL.Peptide mapping of TpeL to identify immunogenic regions suitable for cloning and expression in the vaccine strain.Construct live attenuated S. Typhimurium strains that produce at least three protective proteins from Clostridium perfringens. If this is not possible, we will construct multiple vaccine strains producing one or two antigens that can be co-administered.Characterize vaccine strains in vitro. This will include demonstrating arabinose-regulated antigen production, mannose-regulated O-antigen synthesis and plasmid stability over 50 generations of bacterial growth. Vaccine lysis in the absence of arabinose will also be tested.Evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine constructs in broiler birds. This will include evaluations of serum, mucosal and cellular immunity elicited by the vaccines against relevant Clostridial and Salmonella antigens.Evaluation of protection against virulent C. perfringens challenge after vaccination. Primary outputs measured will be survival (though most birds survive challenge) and intestinal lesions.Evaluation of protection against colonization by wild-type S. Typhimurium. This assay will be done with the vaccine strains providing the best protection against C. perfringens challenge.","chickens, necrotic enteritis, Clostridium perfringens, recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine"

Participation is expected to increase father involvement in positive parenting practices to address youth energy balance-related behaviors (EBRBs) (i.e. sugar sweetened beverage, fruit and vegetable, and breakfast consumption, physical activity and sedentary behavior). An existing parenting curriculum shown to be effective for Latino fathers to prevent youth substance abuse will be adapted using community-based participatory research principles. The 8-week program will address paternal parenting practices related to the food and physical activity environment in the home (role modeling, availability, expectations, communication). A randomized controlled study with a delayed-treatment condition for the control group will be conducted with randomization at the father-youth pair/dyad within community agencies (n=40 dyads in each of 6 sites). Baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3 month post-intervention data will be collected to assess changes in paternal parenting practices, youth EBRBs and weight status. This project addresses the 2015 Program Area Priority to prevent childhood obesity by developing new knowledge about effective obesity prevention practices. The project is innovative because it addresses obesity prevention and healthy behaviors for a growing immigrant population in the United States, and it targets fathers of early adolescents, a group generally not actively involved in family intervention programs, yet is widely recognized for playing a key role in healthy youth development.

Hallmark symptoms of PRRS are mild to severe respiratory disease in infected newborn and growing swine, and reproductive failure in pregnant sows. Both PRRS modified live virus (MLV) and inactivated vaccines are commercially available. Since the first PRRSV MLV became available in 1994, various other MLV and inactivated vaccines have been approved in the USA and Europe. Together with management strategies, these vaccines are able to control disease outbreaks. However, they are not effective in preventing reinfection and transmission. Furthermore, there are safety concerns for MLV. The efficacy of MLV vaccines in protecting against a broad spectrum of heterologous field isolates has also been questioned. In general, inactivated vaccines are safer but less efficacious in inducing protection. Thus, there is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious PRRSV vaccine. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), commonly known as canine parainfluenza virus (CPI) in the veterinary field, is thought to be a contributing factor for kennel cough. Dogs have been vaccinated with kennel cough vaccines containing live PIV5 for over 40 years. No safety concern for dogs or humans has been associated with the kennel cough vaccination. We have developed PIV5 as a vector for vaccine development. The efficacy of PIV5-based vaccines has been tested in laboratory mice, chickens, dogs, pigs and non-human primates. PIV5 generates robust antibody responses as well as CMI in animals.The main objective of this proposal is to test proof-of-principle that PIV5 is an excellent vaccine vector for swine by developing a PRRSV vaccine using PIV5 as a vector. We will generate recombinant PIV5 expressing PRRSV antigens as a potential vaccine for PRRSV. We will immunize pigs with our vaccine candidates and determine their efficacy against PRRSV infection in pigs. If we are successful in obtaining a PIV5-based PRRSV vaccine for swine, not only will we have an effective vaccine for PRRSV, but also develop PIV5 as a platform for vaccines for other swine viruses.","Objective 1: Generating recombinant PIV5 expressing PRRSV antigens as a potential vaccine for PRRSV. In our recent work, we have generated recombinant PIV5 expressing antigens of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rabies virus. A single dose inoculation of the recombinant viruses protects mice from challenge of respective viruses. PRRSV is an important pathogen for swine. A safe and efficacious PRRSV is needed. Based on our successful use of PIV5 as a vector for vaccine development, we hypothesize that PIV5 expressing antigens of PRRSV (PIV5-PRRSV) will be an excellent vaccine candidate for PRRSV. In this objective, we will generate PIV5 expressing antigens of PRRSV and analyze the viruses in cultured cells.Objective 2: Testing efficacy of PIV5-PRRSV in pigs. We will test efficacy of PIV5 in pigs. We will use different routes of administration (intranasal, IN, and intramuscular, IM). We will use single dose as well as prime-boost (homologous and heterologous) in case a single dose immunization is not sufficient. We will use commercial PRRSV vaccine as a control to compare efficacy of our vaccine candidates. We will determine critical antigens for protection if PIV5-PRRSV is effective.Objective 3: Improving efficacy of PIV5-PRRSV in pigs. Our recent studies show that modifications to PIV5 can enhance immune responses to antigens. We hypothesize that regulating host innate immune responses can lead to a better vaccine.

Ultracentrifugation is a fundamental and widely used tool to separate these tiny structures both from the cells themselves and from each other according a property called differential density. This way, as the centrifuge spins a liquid, it will force different structures with different density to either stay in the liquid or sediment at the bottom of the tube into what&#39;s known as a pellet. Ultracentrifugation provides a simple but versatile method to isolate structures of interest, like extracellular vesicles (exosomes), viruses, subcellular organelles, and large pieces of DNA, making it an essential platform to isolate specific molecules as well as quantify them.

PROJECT,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,1008991,2016-67030-24892,Non-Thermal Plasmas as Airborne Pathogen Barriers for Animal Confinement Buildings,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,100000.0,"Clack, HE.",ACTIVE,"Existing procedures for preventing the transmission of diseases to livestock are collectively known as agricultural bio-security. These procedures largely focus on surface disinfection of farm workers and their equipment when entering and exiting animal confinement buildings. However, there is a growing body of evidence indicating a significant threat of disease transmission to animals by particles carried in ventilation air; of particular concern are trans-boundary diseases that can be carried across continents by animal vectors such as migrating birds. Air filters can protect against disease-carrying airborne particles, but their expense can make their use prohibitive. This project experimentally demonstrates and assesses the effectiveness of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings. NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously remove airborne particles and subject them to chemical attack by gaseous species known to promote inactivation of viruses. This project uses a lab-scale NTP reactor to demonstrate the effectiveness of the process on particles containing a relatively benign animal virus, mouse hepatitis coronavirus. Chemical and genome analyses of treated particles provide insight into the specific mechanisms responsible for virus inactivation. Ancillary performance metrics such as ozone production, flow obstruction, and electrical power consumption are also measured. These metrics are essential to the development of a cost-effective technology capable of addressing existing and new disease threats to housed livestock. If successful, NTP-based air disinfection could complement, or diminish the need for, vaccines and antibiotics in animal disease prevention, and versions of the technology could be implemented in a portable format that could be deployed to producers as a real-time response to disease outbreaks.","The goal of this project is to dramatically improve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental controls protecting livestock and agricultural workers. In pursuit of this goal, this project will demonstrate the potential of a non-thermal plasma to serve as an airborne pathogen barrier for animal confinement buildings. Infectious aerosols, or fomites, entrained in ventilation can transmit a number of important infectious diseases including transboundary livestock diseases. Conventional agricultural biosecurity measures target infectious agents transmitted on worker clothing or equipment and cannot address airborne transmission. Conventional air filtration methods can be effective barriers to airborne pathogens but are costly to implement. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, of the two defining characteristics of infectious aerosols - transport and infectivity - conventional air filtration methods only address aerosol transport.The underlying objectives supporting this goal will be achieved through the construction of a laboratory-scale non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactor. Experiments conducted on this reactor will yield baseline NTP performance measures. Specific objectives for the project and these experiments are:Objective 1: Measure aerosol filtration (electrostatic precipitation) performance of the NTP reactor as a function of reactor operating parameters.Objective 2: For an aerosolized surrogate virus entrained in the airflow supplied to the NTP reactor, enumerate the inactivated fraction present at the reactor outlet as a function of reactor operating parameters.Objective 3: Measure hydrodynamic pressure drop across the reactor as a function of reactor operating parameters.Objective 4: Measure ozone concentrations at the reactor outlet as a function of NTP operating parameters.","Aerosols, Infectious Diseases, Virus Inactivation"
PROJECT,SAES – TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,1008996,2016-67015-24958,Arginine and Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 Mediate Cell Signaling to Enhance Conceptus Development and Survival,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,460000.0,"Bazer, FU, W.",ACTIVE,"Embryonic death losses of 20 to 30 percent in sheep can be reduced by supplemental dietary arginine through undefined mechanisms. Knockdown ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) mRNA translation results in normal and abnormal conceptuses. Normal conceptuses increase production of polyamines via the arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and agmatinase (AGMAT) pathway, whereas abnormal conceptuses do not activate that pathway for production of polyamines. Therefore, this application focuses on products of arginine metabolism, specifically agmatine and putrescine, acting in concert with secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), that activate mechanistic target of rapamacin (MTORC1 and MTORC2) cell signaling to stimulate proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal organization and gene expression required for implantation and expression of IFNT for pregnancy recognition. We hypothesize that arginine, agmatine and polyamines alone or with SPP1 activate MTORC1 and MTORC2 to stimulate conceptus development and that progesterone therapy from Day 2 of pregnancy increases transport of arginine and secretion of SPP1 by uterine glandular epithelia to accelerate conceptus development. Specific objectives are to determine cell signaling pathway(s) activated by arginine, agmatine and polyamines that stimulate development and gene expression by conceptuses; effects of knockdown of translation of ADC and AGMAT mRNAs on conceptus development; effects of SPP1 on cytoskeletal organization and conceptus elongation; and effects of circulating concentrations of progesterone from Day 2 of pregnancy on conceptus development.","Our working hypothesis is that Arg is metabolized to agmatine and putrescine which activate MTORC1 and MTORC2 cell signaling to stimulate proliferation, migration, attachment and differentiated functions of ovine trophectoderm (oTr) cells required for elongation of the conceptus and its expression of genes for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, implantation and placentation. This novel hypothesis will be tested by addressing four specific aims or goalsto determine: 1) temporal and cell-specific expression of ADC, AGMAT, ARGI, ARGII, and ODC1 mRNAs and proteins in ovine conceptuses and endometria from Days 13, 14, 15 and 16 of pregnancy, as well as regulation of their expression by progesterone (P4) and IFNT in uterine endometrium; 2) activation of MTORC1 and MTORC2 cell signaling pathway(s) by Arg, putrescine and agmatine alone and with SPP1 to effect changes in cytoskeletal proteins required for elongation of oTr cells; 3) effects of functional knockdown of mRNA translation for specific enzymes (ADC/AGMAT and ARGI/ARGII/ODC1) that metabolize Arg to agmatine and putrescine via either the ADC/AGMAT or ARGI/ARGII/ODC1 pathways for activation of MTORC1, MTORC2 or both MTORC1 and MTORC2 in ovine conceptuses; and 4) effects of P4 supplementation to pregnant ewes to advance the time and magnitude of increases in the abundance of arginine, agmatine and polyamines in uterine and conceptus tissues as related to conceptus development on Days 12 and 16 of the peri-implantation period and on Day 125 of pregnancy when placental development is completed. We wish to determine whether advancing uterine gene expression for increasing abundance of Arg, agmatine and polyamines enhances growth and development of conceptuses on Days 12 and 16 (elongation phase), as well as to Day 125 when we can assess effects of Arg, agmatine and polyamines to enhances growth and development of the placentae and fetuses as determined on Day 125 of pregnancy.","arginine, conceptus, pregnancy, progesterone, sheep, uterus, Agmatine, Polyamines"

PROJECT,1890 - LINCOLN UNIVERSITY,1009026,2016-67022-25033,Innovative Methods To Improve The Sensitivity Of Nanosensors For Detection Of Biomolecules In Food Systems,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,49673.0,"Afrasiabi, ZA.",ACTIVE,"In the event of vegetables and meat contamination with pathogens, a large number of people are affected in a short time due to the highly infectious nature of the pathogens. An effective way to avoid that is to screen the produce or meat before it supplied through the food chain. Also it is important to sample the food in grocery stores and analyze for contamination before food reaches the consumer. Currently available sensors need a technical workforce and are not feasible for day-to-day application. A simple, colorimetric sensor (observing the color change) will enable a simple readout so that any employee could sample food to detect the pathogen. Using our proposed project the average time for sensing will be significantly shortened; thus, these sensors can easily be used in any community worldwide. The nanosensor will have a huge impact on the economy. Indirectly, the utilization of these sensors in the food chain will play a major role in reducing hospital care costs and the length of hospital stay for patients; more importantly, use of such sensors can save lives. By developing a simple colorimetric sensor, the cost of sampling and analyzing is expected to be significantly lower than the costs of current methods, which in turn will have a positive impact on the economy.","The main goal of this project is to receive a short-term training by PI for learning new techniques to specifically increase the sensitivity of nanosensors in detecting biomolecules. It is collaborative arrangement to enhance Lincoln University&#39;s institutional capacity with the goal of leading to future research projects while strengthening the competitiveness of the collaborating investigators&#39; research activities.Due to growing concern about outbreaks of food poisoning and the associated costs, there is always need for development of better sensors that can accurately detect dangerous, disease-causing pathogens. Food and water are the common targets of pathogen contaminations. It is crucial to ensure the safety of the food and water supplies using an accurate, simple, and fast-response device. Existing methods, such as ""electronic noses"" and ""electronic tongues"" require expensive equipment, are time consuming, and involve complicated analyses. There has been ongoing research in this area, especially towards developing simple and portable sensors to detect bacterial contamination.There are two main objectives for this proposed project: a) The PI to receive training on radioactive labeling of proteins with I-125 and mathematical modeling in the collaborator&#39;s laboratory in UCLA; b) Collaborative research of the two investigators at LU and UCLA to develop new techniques for pre-concentrating target molecules prior to detection with paper-based, point-of-need nanosensors.Agriculturalists and infectious disease specialists have emphasized the agricultural need of sensors for infectious diseases. Development of any technique that can improve the detection limit of currently available sensors is expected to create a huge impact in the infectious disease community. By careful variation of the markers, this platform can be used to detect various harmful pathogens.","food safety, nanosensor, Radioactve Labeling"

Control of fire blight is highly dependent on the antibiotic streptomycin. However, streptomycin resistance in E. amylovora population has been commonly found in almost all apple and pear-producing regions in the United States. Therefore, developing novel and effective fire blight control alternatives is an urgent need for the sustainable tree fruit production in the U.S. RNA silencing is a natural process in bacteria in which the translation of a target gene is repressed by an antisense RNA. Based on the notion of RNA silencing, antisense molecules that specifically silence genes essential for survival in a bacterial pathogen will result in antimicrobial effect to the pathogen. Compared to antibiotics, antisense antimicrobials have many attractive attributes, including the ability to only antagonize pathogenic bacteria through sequence specificity without affecting other bacteria, and ability to target multiple essential genes at once. Despite the great potential impact, application of antisense antimicrobials in plant disease management has never been explored. Preliminary data demonstrated that in vivo expression of an antisense RNA in fire blight pathogen E. amylovora caused RNA silencing of a GFP gene. In this proposal, we will explore the feasibility of using the antisense antimicrobials to control fire blight. Knowledge generated from this research will not only provide a valuable control alternative for fire blight, but also could be transformative to other crop systems and have a broader impact to the management of bacterial plant diseases.",Objective 1.

We are proposing an internship program that will provide undergraduate students with a unique opportunity for hands-on experiential learning with campus-based faculty at Cornell University&#39;s NY State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva NY. Our long-term goal is to attract students to agriculturally-based plant sciences and address a critical workforce deficiency. Undergraduate research experience was consistently identified by graduate students as the single most powerful force that subsequently directed their career path, and this proposal seeks to build upon a successful extant undergraduate internship program. Specifically, we seek to extend our current program to a broad range of underrepresented minority students, and thereby increase diversity while at the same time meet critical workforce needs by expanding opportunities in career development. Our project is tied to the NIFA foundational area of &#39;plant health and production and plant products&#39;. All undergraduate internships (including research and extension activities) will occur at Cornell University&#39;s NY State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva NY. Cornell faculty from the Department of Entomology and the School of Integrative Plant Science (including members of the Horticulture and Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Sections) will serve as mentors for undergraduate students recruited from across the US. There are 17 enthusiastic faculty that will serve as mentors, with ten students per year that will attend our summer internship program through this grant (with a maximum total of 24 students in the program). Thus, each faculty mentor will have 1 or 2 interns. Based on past participation of Cornell undergrads in our program, we expect 1 student of the 10 year to be from Cornell, and will cap the number of Cornell students at 2 (or 20% of the total each year). Students will come to Cornell&#39;s Geneva campus for nine weeks each year, and there is no international component to this proposal. Other organizations including minority serving institutions involved in this project include; Hobart and William Smith Colleges (where students are housed), Langston University, Cal Poly Pomona, West Virginia State University, Delaware State University, Tuskeegee university, Florida A&amp;M University, and New Mexico State University.","Our long-term goal is to address a critical workforce deficiency in agriculturally-based plant sciences. These professions use research-based knowledge to develop and extend innovative solutions to serious problems facing US agriculture.Our primary objective is to extend the benefits of a successful undergraduate internship program to the greatest number of underrepresented minority students, and thereby increase the diversity of undergraduate students who will soon enter graduate school and/or a critical segment of the agricultural workforce. This is an integrated project with stakeholders having been involved in the development of the project since 2009, and they are enthusiastic to attract undergraduates to the plant sciences. Our research objective is to develop a program where a diverse group of students will become an integral part of translational research addressing problems facing growers or producers in New York and beyond. The educational objective is to provide an outstanding 9-week summer experiential learning internship for 10 undergraduate Summer Scholars. Our extension objective is to provide students opportunities to engage in extension/outreach opportunities and put this into context with the land grant mission.

PROJECT,SAES - PURDUE UNIVERSITY,1009083,2016-67011-25095,Biosynthesis in the longhorned beetle Neoclytus m. mucronatus Coleoptera Cerambycidae,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,39500.0,"Hughes, GA, PA.",ACTIVE,"Longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) are among the most economically important pests of natural and managed forest systems worldwide, and are sometimes introduced to new locales via transcontinental cargo shipments. Pheromones are often used in detection and monitoring efforts of exotic invasive wood-boring beetles. However, little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds in the Cerambycidae. Our specific objectives are to 1) Determine the biosynthetic pathway by which pheromones are produced in the cerambycine Neoclytus m. mucronatus, and 2) Identify pheromone biosynthetic genes by comparing transcripts of calling male N. m. mucronatus with those not actively calling. To determine if pheromones are produced via fatty-acid synthesis, we will apply a fatty acid synthase inhibitor to male beetles and determine the extent to which pheromone production is reduced. We will also perform differential gene expression analysis to identify genes involved in pheromone production, and validate those genes using qPCR. The rationale for this project is that understanding the physiological mechanisms involved in pheromone biosynthesis will enable the development of novel methods for controlling these pests by interfering with pheromone production, and consequently disrupting mate location to protect our nation&#39;s natural and urban forests.","Despite the growing body of knowledge regarding cerambycid semiochemistry, there is a paucity of information concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in pheromone production. Much of the existing literature on pheromone biosynthesis focuses on moths (Tillman et al. 1999; Jurenka 2003, 2004; Rafaeli 2005), and, to a lesser extent, bark beetles (reviewed in Blomquist et al. 2010). Numerous enzymes have been identified in the biosynthetic pathway of both fatty acid- and isoprenoid-derived pheromones. For example, there are more than five subgroups of desaturases, enzymes commonly found in moth pheromone production, that introduce a double bond into a hydrocarbon chain (reviewed by Xue et al. 2012). Isoprenoid biosynthesis involves various reductases and cytochrome P450s (Sandstrom et al. 2006; Huber et al. 2007). A farnesyl diphosphate synthase has recently been identified in T. fuscum (Mayo et al. 2013), but this gene is associate with the mevalonate pathway. It is currently unknown what genes are involved in pheromone production in the Cerambycinae, but transcriptomic approaches will reveal novel glimpses into pheromone biosynthesis in this group of longhorned beetles.The overall goal of this research is to identify the biochemical pathways and physiological processes that regulate pheromone production in the longhorned beetles. Our studies will focus on the cerambycine, Neoclytus m. mucronatus as a model for pheromone biosynthesis within the subfamily because it is an abundant species in the Midwest, and its pheromone comprises a single compound, (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one, making identification of genes simpler. Several longhorned beetles in the subfamily Cerambycinae are pests of crops and forest lands. The coffee white stem borer, Xylotrechus quadripes Chevrolat, is a serious pest of Coffea arabica, and can cause up to $40 million annually for replacement of trees and loss of crop in India (Hall et al. 2006). The grape borer, Xylotrechus pyrrhoderus Bates, is a harmful pest of grape vines in Japan (Kiyota et al. 2009). Here in the United States, the red oak borer, Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman), was responsible for widespread decline of oaks during an outbreak period from 2001-2005, even though it is usually only a minor pest of oaks (Riggins et al. 2009). Understanding the biosynthetic pathway involved in pheromone production may reveal novel methods of control by targeting key steps in pheromone biosynthesis. The objectives of this proposal are outlined below.Objective 1. Determine the biosynthetic pathway by which pheromones are produced in the cerambycine Neoclytus m. mucronatus. My working hypothesis is that pheromone production in N. m. mucronatus can be inhibited with injections of 2-octynoic acid, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor.Objective 2. Identify pheromone biosynthetic genes by comparing transcripts of calling male N. m. mucronatus and those not actively calling. My working hypothesis is that transcripts of genes involved in pheromone production will be more highly expressed in males that are actively releasing pheromone.","fatty acid, fatty acid synthesis, pheromone biosynthesis, Cerambycinae, differential gene expression"

Macroscale or microscale biomaterials are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and do not pose health risks to consumers. However, the biological effects and toxicity of nanoscale biomaterials cannot be predicted solely from their chemical structures. There are many factors that may affect the interaction of nanoscale biomaterials with cells and living organisms, including the size, shape, aggregation status, degree of branching, surface properties, and hybrid materials. A particular concern is the safety of hybrid nanomaterials and nanocomposites, such as nanocellulose impregnated with antimicrobial agents including nanosize metal particles, that may pose risks to humans, livestock, and the environment. So far,Little is known about the behavior and the potential side effects of nanobiomaterials as they travel through the GI tract, and how nanobiomaterials may translocate across the cell membrane.To understand the fate and behavior of nanobiomaterials in GI tract, it is critical to have a suitable and robust analytical methodology for detection and characterization of nanobiomaterials. Over the last five years, we have been working on detection and characterization of engineered nanoparticles in food matrices. Because no single technique can address this need and provide all the necessary information, we developed a combination of methods that are sensitive enough for the measurement of low concentrations of nanoparticles in food, can observe the state of aggregation, dispersion, size, structure, shape of nanoparticles and other measurable properties, and are suitable for both liquid and solid food matrices. We have also conducted preliminary trials in the behavior of nanocellulose in the food matrix during digestion. Dynamic stomach and intestinal models were developed providing realistic simulation of physiological conditions in GI tract. This work has built a solid foundation for this project. We hereby propose to examine how nanobiomaterials behave after ingestion, their interaction with food components, the impact on natural gut microflora and the toxicological effect, using both in vitro and in vivo methods.This project will fill the knowledge gap about the behavior of nanocellulose and hybrid nanomaterials during digestion and their toxicity effects.","Nanobiomaterials, such as cellulose nanofibers (CNF) and CNF-based antimicrobial agents, may enter the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as a food ingredient or through ingestion of food contaminated by packaging materials containing nanomaterials.

Research projects were designed to address the most relevant determinants of Ecosystem Services (ES) of grasslands and to address them within the context of their response to plant species composition and defoliation management. These responses include root mass and root exudates; bulk soil and fraction soil organic C (SOC) and total N; plant residue deposition, quality, and decomposition; GHG emissions from livestock excreta and grazing livestock; nitrate leaching; and animal production. This comprehensive approach will provide a thorough assessment of grassland ES and guide choices of species and defoliation management practices to optimize ES delivery.

We will integrate all these results in a life cycle assessment, which will allow us to design the supply curves for major ES provided by grasslands.","Research projects were designed to address the most relevant determinants of Ecosystem Services (ES) of grasslands and to address them within the context of their response to plant species composition and defoliation management. These responses include root mass and root exudates; bulk soil and fraction soil organic C (SOC) and total N; plant residue deposition, quality, and decomposition; GHG emissions from livestock excreta and grazing livestock; nitrate leaching; and animal production. This comprehensive approach will provide a thorough assessment of grassland ES and guide choices of species and defoliation management practices to optimize ES delivery. The assessment will also include an estimate of cattlemen&#39;s willingness to include legumes as part of their management program; a GHG emissions estimate of beef production from representative farm operations; and a supply curve analysis of legume-based ES (C and N).Specific objectives are:To quantify and compare effects of defoliation management and plant species composition on a) root production and root exudates to elucidate mechanisms governing short-term C inputs and stabilization in soil and b) intermediate-term changes in bulk soil and soil particle size fraction C and N concentrations to validate short-term data.Determine the effect of grassland plant species composition and the proportion of legume in mixed-species grasslands on a) GHG emissions from soil and excreta of grazing animals and b) plant residue mass, nutrient composition, and nutrient release.At a field scale, quantify and compare provisioning (animal weight gain), regulating (SOC; CH4 emissions from grazing livestock; soil GHG emissions) and supporting ES (nutrient cycling as affected by N fixation, plant litter decomposition, nitrate leaching, excreta output and composition) for legume-grass and grass-N systems.Simulate the financial impacts of defoliation management and plant species composition practices and associated animal weight gain changes for representative farms, estimate impacts of these practices on ES, and assess producers&#39; willingness to accept compensation for adopting these practices.","carbon, ecosystem services, grassland, legumes, nutrient cycling, Valuation"

Thus it is critical for scientists to determine novel ways to combat plant diseases.Like humans, plants have immune systems to ward off disease.Rice is a staple crop for more than half the world, and so it is important to study it&#39;s immune system such that scientists can find ways to prevent certain diseases from adversely affecting rice yield. Bacterial blightdisease of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection, results in epidemicsin many parts of the world. About 50 years ago, plant breeders identified a variety of rice in Africa that is naturally resistant to bacterial blight disease. In 1995, the Ronald lab identified the protein that confers robust and broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo in rice, called XA21(Xanthomonas resistance 21). Although XA21 was identified over 20 years ago, the mechanism by which XA21 confersimmunity is still largely unknown. Studies aimed at elucidating the gene network involved inXa21-mediated immunity can help in understanding rice innate immunity. Here I propose to study genes that are important for the plant immune response but have not been yet been examined or characterized in any plant species. In my first objective, I used a novel computational prediction tool to identify three genes that are likely to be involved in the Xa21-mediated immune response. I then generated transgenic plants that are silenced for the three genes, in plants that are resistant to Xoo infection since they contain XA21. If these plants that are silenced for the three genes demonstrate altered in resistance to Xoo infection, compared to XA21-containing plants that are not silenced for the three genes, then the three genes are involved in Xa21-mediated immunity. In my second objective, I will study an XA21 containing rice plant that lost resistance to bacterial blight disease becuase the plant has a large genetic deletion region in the genome. I hypothesize that one gene in the deletion region is responsible for the loss of resistance to bacterial blight disease in the mutant. The novelty of studying these genes is particularly exciting, and my results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications. This work is particularly importantbecause it is crucial to understand disease process in cereals as they produce most food in the world. Rice is a great model for cereals with immediate applications, and pathways controlling innate immune responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, so the expected results will be relevant to other species.","The overarching goal of this project is to work towards understanding rice innate immunity. XA21(Xanthomonas resistance 21)confers robust and broad-spectrum resistance toXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection, which results in epidemics in many parts of the world. The projectgoal is to identify and validate genes in the Xa21 gene network, using a reverse and forward genetics approach. Myfirst objectiveis to validate the role of three receptor- like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), calledRox Subnetwork Kinases(RSK) 1, 2, and 3,in Xa21-mediated immunity. I identified these RLCKs using RiceNet, arecently established a network of rice genescompiled from a mixture ofgenomic and proteomic data spanning roughly 50% of the over 41000 protein coding genes inrice. I then generated knockdownlines by stable transformation of artificial micro RNA constructs(amiRNA) into the resistant Xa21-Kitaake and the susceptibleKitaake genetic backgrounds to determine if the Rsk genesregulate Xa21- mediated immunity. For thefirst part of objective 1, I will complete transgenic analysis of T1 linessoI can clearly determine if thereis co-segregation of the phenotype, transgene, and Rsk gene silencing. If I confirm co-segregation in the T1 lines, thesecond part of objective 1will be to characterize the RSK proteins. I observed interaction of the three RSK proteins withXB15, aphosphatase which negatively regulates Xa21-mediated immunity, in theheterologous yeast system. I will thus confirm this interaction byperforming a co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay to investigate thein vivo interaction of RSK proteins with XB15. ForObjective 2, I willidentify the causative gene in mutant simx3, identified from a forward genetics screen aimed at identifying new components of Xa21-mediated innate immunity. For thefirst part of objective 2, I will determine if the uncharacterizedgene upregulated upon Xoo infection (Uxi), which isupregulated in response to Xoo infectionupon analysis of RNA-seq data,is responsible for the loss of resistancephenotype in the simx3 mutant. I will clone the annotated gene (with the native promoter, coding region, and 3&#39; terminator sequence), which spans a 3.8 kb region, andtransform the Uxi gene into the mutant background to test if I can rescue the phenotype. For the second part of objective 2, I will determine if Uxi is involved in basal immunity in rice. First, I will clone an overexpression construct for Uxi and transform the construct into susceptible Kitaake plants, and subsequently inoculate the T1 plants that have the transgene.I will also cross the susceptible Kitaake plants with simx3 plants, and screen the resulting F2 progeny to identify segregants that show absence for both Uxi and the Ubi-Xa21 gene. These plants will be challenged with Xoo together with Kitaake control plants. If the phenotype in these F2 progeny show a more susceptible phenotype compared to the Kitaake control plants, then the UXI protein is a positive regulator of basal immunity in rice.","bacterial blight, innate immunity, rice, RSK proteins, RiceNet, Uxi, XA21, Xoo, simx3"

Cell testing models that predict vaccine efficacy by the strength and quality of antigen-specific memory B cell responses are needed to reduce the time and expense of precision development of improved vaccines against high consequence livestock diseases. We hypothesize that memory B cells restimulated in vitro recapitulate pathogen challenge of immune livestock, and propose a vaccine testing model using porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection of swine, since current vaccines and natural infection typically induce weakly neutralizing antibodies and incomplete protection. Better PRRS vaccines are a major industry need.Specific aims are: 1. To experimentally enhance an in vitro culture system for characterization of PRRSV-immune memory B cell populations. 2.

However this response appears to vary considerably depending upon several key factors that drive the sulfur cycle in agroecosystems. At present we lack a reliable diagnostic soil or plant test that indicates sulfur deficiency or the probability of observing a response to sulfur fertilization. To meet this critical producer need, we will develop a model based on previous work of our team and utilizing several freely available national geodatabases to predict sulfur deficiency for major crops grown across U.S. farmlands. The predictive ability of the model will be validated using on-farm strip trials in Ohio, a state that has had dramatic reductions in atmospheric sulfur deposition, making it especially vulnerable to sulfur deficiency. The modelling outputs will be integrated into a GIS platform to develop high-resolution sulfur deficiency maps. This free, publicly available website will allow growers, crop advisors and other stakeholders to drill down into their fields on the map, input crop management and determine the likelihood of an agronomic response to sulfur fertilization. Further the developed model will be applied to future climate scenarios to assess any potential vulnerability on sulfur nutrition for crops resulting from projected climate change.

The Forest Service approach to accelerating forest restoration is based, in part, on creating high-value markets for low-value wood. One high-value material that has generated considerable recent interest and that can be extracted from wood removed during restoration is nanocellulose. Nanocellulose is widely available and has outstanding properties such as high stiffness and strength and low density, which makes it an excellent candidate as a bio-renewable reinforcement in the rapidly growing advanced polymer composites market. One logical market for nanocellulose penetration is automotive where the convergence of recent trends in lightweighting, nanotechnology, and the increasing use of natural fibers are favorable for nanocellulose adoption.In this project, we investigate innovative design architectures using nanocellulose and hyperbranched polymers, synthetically derived tree-like macromolecules, which when impregnated in polymers will yield high strength nanocomposites. Additionally, we propose a unique supercritical fluid assisted injection-molding technology to enhance dispersion of nanocellulose within the polymeric matrix, a key factor for augmenting performance. Overall, the goal is to transform the most desirable yet undervalued natural nanomaterial &#39;nanocellulose&#39; into a high value advanced biorenewable reinforcement which, if successful, will open up entirely new avenues for nanocellulose use within the automotive industry and beyond.","The proposed project provides a two-fold understanding of the nanocellulosic material. First, it provides a fundamental understanding of the performance characteristics of nanocellulose through innovative design architectures and covalent conjugate chemistries. Second, it investigates the applicability of engineered nanocellulose based roding nanostructures in high- value and superior-performance engineering applications such as those found in the automotive sector via a unique ScF-assisted manufacturing technology.

Our project studies the insects most commonly found in the crops regularly linked to foodborne illness outbreaks, along with the human pathogens causing those diseases. Our studies use lettuce as a leafy green model and tomato, two of the most common fresh produce vehicles of foodborne illness. The expected outcome is to identify insect colonization factors of enteric bacteria, knowledge of plant defense pathways that influence human pathogen persistence, and fundamental biology of the interaction between plants-microbes-insects which influences human pathogen survival and dispersal in and among crop plants with an ultimate goal of reducing human illness.","One in six Americans suffers from food-borne illness each year.

Since blackcurrant farming started in the U.S. in 2003, it has gained popularity due to its potential health benefits. Our preliminary studies suggest that blackcurrant prevents adipose inflammation and hyperglycemia, enhances the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis/bioenergetics, and decreases the inflammatory action of splenic monocytes in diet-induced obesity mice. Based on these findings, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that blackcurrant enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy utilization in the skeletal muscle and prevents monocyte phenotypic switch from anti-inflammatory M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 type in bone marrow and spleen. This, in turn, prevents fat and reactive oxygen species accumulation and inhibits recruitment of M1 macrophages in adipose and skeletal muscle, ultimately inhibiting obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). The proposed research will employ a combination of cell and animal experiments to systematically determine the bioactivity of blackcurrant as related to the prevention of inflammation and IR in obesity focusing on mitochondrial functions and monocytes/macrophage phenotypic switch. By examining the potential interplay of macrophages and mitochondria in triggering inflammation and IR, the proposed study will allow us to gain novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of blackcurrant against inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity.

PROJECT,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,1007216,2016-67021-24420,Increasing Crop Water Use Efficiency Through SCADA Control of Variable Rate Irrigation Systems Using Plant and Soil Sensor Feedback,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,493752.0,"Evett, ST, RO.",ACTIVE,"The rationale for the project lies in these facts: 1) Irrigated agriculture produces more than 40% of agricultural products on &lt;20% of agricultural land in the nation, producing $67 billion in farm gate receipts, but uses approximately 60% of national freshwater resources, a significant portion of which is lost due to poor irrigation scheduling while unintentionally moving nutrients into streams and lakes; 2) There are &gt;$400 million savings in water, energy and fertilizer that remain unclaimed due to the failure of ET based and soil water sensor based agricultural irrigation scheduling to gain wide adoption and the relative lack of precision of those methods when used alone; 3) The proven ability of sensor-feedback-based irrigation control systems to optimize irrigation applications and water use efficiency; 4) The fact that &gt;70% of American irrigation systems are now pressurized (NASS, 2014) and thus are amenable to sensor-feedback control; 5) The fact that the major manufacturers of pressurized irrigation systems, both center pivot and linear move, offer variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems, and the major manufacturers of drip irrigation systems offer zone control; and 6) The fact that despite the availability of VRI and drip irrigation systems amenable to control, there is a nearly complete lack of commercial technology for writing VRI or zone control prescriptions that respond day to day to actual crop water needs and that allow site-specific optimization of water and nutrient use efficiency while stabilizing yields.This project directly addresses the need for efficient water and nutrient use in irrigation agriculture by developing new wireless sensor technology, integrating wireless sensor networks for plant and soil water status with wireless weather data acquisition into a user-friendly system for irrigation control and management, and developing new algorithms for control through software/firmware engineering. And, it specifically addresses the national needs to protect and sustain local and global food supply and security, and the sustainable use of natural resources. The project addresses the need to improve the efficiency of energy and water use by enabling engineering, computing and information systems for plant production, while refining the sustainability of agricultural systems. And, it addresses three primary challenges: Keeping American agriculture competitive while ending world hunger; Adapting agriculture to climate variability and change and mitigating their effects; and Solving critical water resource problems in rural and agricultural watersheds across the United States.The advanced sensors and irrigation control system will be applicable to most of the pressurized agricultural irrigation systems in the nation, which makes it applicable to &gt;37 million acres of irrigated land. The project is directly aimed at developing and enabling engineering, computing and information systems for natural resource conservation and plant production, by improving efficiency of energy and water use. Success will refine the sustainability of agricultural systems and improve economic, environmental and social outcomes in water limited regions.Potential savings in pumping and fertilizer costs exceed $400 million annually due to the improvements in WUE that come with sensor-based SCADA irrigation management. When yield stabilization and improvements are added, the total improvement in farm income exceeds $1 billion. The absence of VRI prescription decision support systems in the market will be addressed by introduction of a sensor-based system for prescription generation that is made robust by combined plant, soil and weather sensing in a feed-back and mutually self-correcting system. This and the new sensors that will be developed will be manufactured and sold by at least three companies and will be completely novel in the marketplace.","Our goal is to develop a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for irrigation management using advanced engineering based on soil, biological and atmospheric sciences, and based on integration of wireless plant, soil water and weather sensing systems with computer and IT systems to produce site-specific irrigation prescriptions that may be manually or automatically applied to variable rate irrigation systems in order to optimize water and fertilizer use efficiencies. Included in the approach is development of advanced wireless sensor systems for detection of crop health, cover fraction and water stress. The SCADA system will: 1) Reduce runoff and deep percolation losses of water, nutrients and agrochemicals from fields; 2) Reduce water use; 3) Reduce energy consumed for pumping; 4) Improve profitability and sustainability of rural economies; 5) Increase production of food, fuel and fiber; and 6) Increase overall water use efficiency (use efficiency of both precipitation and irrigation).Objectives are:1) Develop wireless, multi-band, integrated computer vision and thermal infrared sensor systems for detection of plant cover fraction, plant health, and plant water stress levels;2) Develop advanced wireless soil water sensor systems;3) Develop corresponding algorithms for prescribing water application in response to these biotic and abiotic stresses;4) Develop robust, advanced simulation systems for determining site-specific crop water use (evapotranspiration, ET) based on flexible and complementary combinations of sensed weather, canopy fraction, plant stress, soil water status and weather; and5) integrate these sensing and computational systems into the SCADA system with a farmer-friendly graphical user interface, including integration with the Internet (cloud) for remote access and control.","crop water use efficiency, site-specific irrigation, variable-rate irrigation, wireless sensors"

Previous research has identified the biosynthetic pathways in microbes and in plant plastids, but little work addresses the potential of a shikimate pathway in the cytosol of plant cells. Here I propose the study of the first committed step of the cytosolic pathway, that of the DAHP synthase. The enzyme will be purified, and the encoding gene identified and cloned. Recombinant expression in E coli will be used to complete biochemical characterization of the enzyme. Reverse genetic techniques, in conjunction with metabolite analysis, will provide insight into the physiological importance of the cytosolic shikimate pathway. Concurrently, upregulation of the pathway via overexpression of a feedback-insensitive DAHP synthase from E. coli will be used to assess its potential for manipulation toward the goal of targeted metabolic engineering for the improvement of crop species, in particular for phenylpropanoids such as lignin. Novel metabolic engineering strategies based on the knowledge gained from this research will directly contribute to maintaining the competitive edge of the American farmer through improved food, fiber, and biofuel producing crops, as is a key goal of the USDA, and completion of the project will contribute to the career development of an agricultural researcher.","Based on classical biochemistry studies, I hypothesize that in addition to the plastidial pathway, plants utilize a second, complete cytosolic pathway for the synthesis of chorismate and the derived AAAs, and that this pathway is under different regulatory control than its plastidial counterpart. It is my goal to identify contributing enzymes of the cytosolic pathway and determine the relative contribution to synthesis of AAAs and their derivatives. As a key component of this goal, I will target the cytosolic shikimate pathway for an engineering strategy to explore the regulation of biosynthesis of AAAs their derivatives. Notably, I seek to disrupt the diurnal production of AAA-derived phenylpropanoid scent compounds in petunia. Towards accomplishment of this goal, I propose the followed specific objectives:Research Objective 1: Identify, clone, and characterize the cytosolic DAHP synthase, and use reverse genetic techniques to analyze its in vivo contribution to AAA biosynthesisResearch Objective 2: Assess the efficacy of the cytosolic shikimate pathway as a target for metabolic engineering of phenylpropanoids","Aromatic Amino Acids, Chorismate, DAHP Synthase, Shikimate, phenylalanine, phenylpropanoid"

In insects, these associations might be exploited to serve as an alternative and safe method of pest control. One such association, with the bacterium Wolbachia, is promising due to its ability to spread in a population and modify insect reproduction. These interactions are being exploited to both: 1) control pesty insects through manipulating population sizes, and 2) increase population sizes and effectiveness of beneficial insects by creating more females. Unfortunately little is known about the mechanisms and evolutionary history of this system. Currently, attempts to establish a Wolbachia infection in a new insect have proven difficult. The most successful transfers have been into mosquitoes, where ongoing trials showing that release of these new, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes can prevent disease transmission, and keep mosquito populations at bay. This is a promising new approach to pest control -- the hope is to use Wolbachia to knock down populations of agricultural pests and the pathogens that they transmit, as well.The commonly used biological control agents, Trichogramma wasps, provide an experimentally ideal and agriculturally relevant system with which to study host-adaptation in Wolbachia. Objectives of the proposed project are: 1) Identify Wolbachia genes under selection pressure during host-adaptation using a novel experimental evolution system, and, 2) Identify Wolbachia genes evolving rapidly across Trichogramma, allowing for host-specificity. In the first objective, a genome re-sequencing approach will be used to track mutations that occur when Wolbachia is challenged with a new Trichogramma host. The second objective will employ the comparative genomics of Wolbachia strains across Trichogramma to look for evolutionary signatures of adaptation. Findings can be applied to improving and informing the transfer of Wolbachia to pesty insects, and improving the efficiency of Trichogramma in biological control.","Goal:The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand how the bacterial reproductive symbiont, Wolbachia, adapts to and manipulates its host: the parasitic wasps, and commonly used biological control agents, of the genus Trichogramma.Objectives:1) Identify Wolbachia genes under selection pressure during host-adaptation.2) Identify Wolbachia genes implicated in Trichogramma host-specificity.","adaptation, biological control, genomics, wolbachia"

Despite advances in hurdle technologies, over 30% of the fresh produce in North America is wasted, largely due to microbial spoilage that results from- limitations of the current washing and sanitation procedures in achieving a significant inactivation of spoilage microorganisms, cross-contamination, and adaptability of microflora to grow under refrigerated and modified storage conditions. To address these challenges, this proposal evaluates two distinct ultrasound (US) based sonochemical approaches. The aim 1 will focus on a synergistic interaction of low-frequency (&lt;50 kHz) US with sonocatalytic coating on food-contact surfaces to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. We hypothesize that food-grade sonocatalytic materials such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide will generate sufficient ROS (reactive oxygen species) upon exposure to US to efficiently inactivate spoilage microbes on these surfaces, thus reducing the risk of biofilm formation and cross-contamination. The aim 2 will focus on microbubbles assisted high-frequency (1-10 MHz) US process to inactivate spoilage microorganisms on fresh produce and wash water while maintaining the produce quality. We hypothesize that controlled cavitation from exposure of food-grade microbubbles to high-frequency US (1- 10 MHz) will trigger ROS generation from food-grade sonocatalytic compounds in wash water. Together, they will effectively inactivate microorganisms while minimizing the mechanical damage to fresh produce commonly associated with conventional low-frequency US (~ 50 kHz) . These hypotheses are supported from literature and preliminary work. In aim 3, we will evaluate extension of shelf-life of produce by proposed approaches and perform preliminary cost-benefit analysis.","Post-harvest spoilage of fresh whole and cut produce is a significant challenge that impacts sustainability, economics and nutritional aspects of fresh produce.

Ruminant livestock (cows, sheep, goats)are an important part of the food production system because they have the unique ability to convert human inedible fiber (plants) into high quality, human edible protein (meat, milk). Unfortunately, ruminants are particularly affected by changes in climate and thus projected climate change is a notable barrier to improving livestock sustainability. Heat stress, in particular, already accounts for $1.7 billion in losses in the livestock sector annually. As the climate warms, this economic and productive burden will increase. To improve efficiency of heat stressed animals, we must better understand how feed is digested and how nutrients are absorbed (and subsequently made available to the animal for use as energy or protein-building blocks). The goal of this project is to identify how digestion of feed and absorption of nutrients are changed when animals are heat stressed. Ruminant animals have a complex microbial ecosystem dwelling in their digestive system and this microbial population is responsible for digesting feed. To understand how outside temperature affects digestion in ruminant animals, we will identify key species of microbe responsible for unique roles (digesting fiber, digesting sugar etc.) and monitor how their populations shift after an animal is exposed to heat stress. Additionally, we will add labeled molecules into the rumen (digestive chamber) that will allow us to track the production and absorption of the end-products of the digestive process. We believe that shifts in blood flow occur to help the animal maintain body temperature and these shifts in blood flow likely affect how effectively nutrients are absorbed. Blood flow to the digestive system will be monitored by infusing labeled molecules into the rumen and evaluating how those labeled molecules disappear over time. We will also measure the abundance of proteins responsible for transporting digested nutrients across the rumen wall into the blood stresm. By collecting information about shifts in microbial populations in the digestive system and resulting changes in nutrient digestion rates, we can better understand how temperature stress affects digestion of feed. By collecting information about how digestive end products are removed from the rumen and how blood flow and nutrient transporters are changing, we willdevelop an improved understanding of how heat stress affects absorption of nutrients. The overall goal of this projectis to generate knowledge that can be applied to help improve feed efficiency (conversion of human inedible feed into human edible food) of ruminant livestock exposed to hot environments. A notable portion of ruminant animals in the U.S. are exposed to several months of thermal stress and the productivity losses associated with this stress are substantial. By better understanding how the animal digests and absorbs food when it is stressed, new feeding strategies can be tailored to help ensure stressed animals recieve sufficient nutrition. Feeding stressed animals more precisely will help to ensure that sufficient high quality, human edible protein is available for the growing global population.","The long-term goal of this project is to improve our knowledge of the potential mechanisms driving volatile fatty acid (VFA) absorption and our understanding of the interactions among VFA absorption mechanisms, thermal environment, and livestock feed efficiency.

We propose to develop a tools and reagents platform for delivering one to several edits to the genome, determine the prevalence of off-target effects, and to demonstrate proof of principle for direct introgression via embryo microinjection. Towards this goal, we will first evaluate novel methods to improve the frequency and accuracy of TALEN or RGEN mediated homology dependent repair in bovine cells by cell cycle manipulation and inhibition of NHEJ. We will apply these improvements of the gene editing process to introgress five polymorphisms in genes that have been previously identified as having major effects on performance traits either singly or together. These edits will be performed in fibroblasts from Dominette, the Hereford cow sequenced to establish the bovine genome reference assembly. This will enable robust characterization of unintended effects by whole genome sequencing and comparison to the genome reference assembly. A second arm of the proposal will aim at direct introgression of alleles that cause the SLICK phenotype, a phenotype that results in better temperature regulation and welfare of cattle raised in warm environments, using standard industry practices of in vitro fertilization, embryo injection and transfer to recipients. Novel combinations of new reagents will be evaluated to improve both the frequency and accuracy of SLICK introgression. The resulting calves will be evaluated for the slick-haired phenotype. Finally, we will extend our novel bioinformatics software packages to estimate the value of gene editing in livestock populations where genome selection is currently underway. This software will provide answers to how gene editing can impact populations and how best to implement gene editing in the context of genomic selection to maximize gains. Results and resources developed in this proposal will be published and shared, will demonstrate proof of principle for gene editing as a tool for livestock breeding along with informatics to deploy it and establish a practical dataset for US regulators to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these tools for use in food animals.","Goal 1: To evaluate the efficiency of single and multiplex allele-introgression. The majority of high-effect targets for introgression are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We will characterize and optimize the efficiency and fidelity of TALEN-based introgression at five exemplar loci; SLICK, PLAG1, DGAT1, MSTN and ABCG2, which were chosen based on their potential for phenotypic and economic improvement of cattle breeds. Conditions and reagents will be optimized to edit these individual loci, and will also be developed to edit all 5 loci by multiplex gene-editing.Sub-goal 1.1 Test off-target effects. In order to test for off-target effects we will analyze the genome sequence of edited and non-edited primary cells from ""Dominette"", the Hereford cow that was sequenced to establish the bovine reference genome sequence. Cellular clones positive for multiplex editing will be expanded for extraction of genomic DNA (gDNA), and whole-genome and locus re-sequencing. The number and types of off-target mutations will be quantified relative to the reference sequence, and will be compared to informatics-predicted off-targets, and to those observed in cellular clones derived from individual gene editors.Goal 2: To evaluate embryo gene-editing for validation of hypothesized candidate polymorphisms. Animal cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer or chromatin transfer (SCNT or CT) is expensive, inefficient and technically challenging. While editing by cloning makes sense for some objectives, in the context of a genetic improvement program it represents a return to ""historical"" genetics (as old as the animal being cloned). Additionally, cloning is not available on a large enough scale to be of general utility as a research tool. We propose to extend our progress in direct embryo editing. As an exemplar, we will introgress the candidate polymorphism for SLICK, a dominant, qualitative coat-character trait, into embryos derived from U.S. abbatoir-sourced ovaries. Once conditions have been optimized for introgression of SLICK into embryos, we will generate animals to test the hypothesized relationship between the candidate genotype and the SLICK coat-character trait.Goal 3: To develop an informatics platform for gene editing. We will combine and adapt quantitative genetics tools developed by Dr. John Hickey (key collaborator) to simulate and predict the gains to livestock populations from gene editing. These tools will form the spine of a pipeline that enables rank identification of gene editing targets for strategic integration into a breeding program.

Root foraging encompasses the morphological and physiological plastic responses utilized by roots to exploit heterogeneously distributed resources. Soils are extremely heterogeneous environments. However, it is not yet clear how agricultural management influences the heterogeneous distribution of resource within the soil, and how that in turn influences belowground competition. Recent crop breeding efforts have aimed to enhance root foraging, but foraging responses are not always predictable under competitive environments. The goal of this project is to compare root foraging strategies among maize varieties (Zea mays) and common weeds, and evaluate how spatially heterogeneous resources influence root foraging and maize-weed competition.We will use a series of greenhouse experiments to characterize root foraging of maize and weeds, with and without competition. We will also conduct a field experiment to determine the effects of cover crop residue spatial heterogeneity on the distribution and availability of soil resources, root foraging and mycorrhizae colonization, and weed-crop competition. We will utilize a novel approach to directly study the mechanisms influencing competition by using 15N enrichment combined with high pressure dye injection. 15N enriched red clover residue will allow us to directly trace the flow of N from resources of specific sizes and location within the soil. A high pressure dye injection system will be used to stain roots and facilitate identification to species.Improved understanding of the effects of soil resource heterogeneity and root foraging plasticity on weed-crop competition will enhance our capacity to adapt crops to low-input environments, and reduce our reliance on herbicides and synthetic fertilizers. Long-term outcomes include increased awareness among researchers of the role that soil heterogeneity plays in mediating belowground competition, as well as increased appreciation among breeders of the importance of considering belowground competitiveness when selecting for root traits. An additional outcome is a deeper understanding of how nutrient placement (N banding, manure injection, zonal cover cropping) influences crop N uptake and weed competition. Results from the proposed research will be disseminated through presentations at academic and scientific meetings, publications in scientific journals, and extension presentations and bulletins.","The goal of this project is to compare root foraging strategies among maize and common agricultural weeds, and evaluate how spatially heterogeneous resources within the soil influence root foraging and maize-weed competition.Specific objectives and hypotheses include:Objective 1: Characterize root morphological and physiological plasticity and N uptake in maize and common agricultural weeds grown in monoculture with spatially heterogeneous and homogeneously distributed soil resources.Objective 1 Hypotheses: We predict that: 1) weed and crop species will vary in N uptake and root: shoot (R:S) ratios in response to heterogeneous soil environments; and 2) compared to crop species, weed species will have greater plasticity in root morphological and physiological foraging response and higher 15N uptake under heterogeneous compared to homogeneous soil resource environments.Objective 2: Evaluate the effects of soil resource spatial heterogeneity and root morphological and physiological plasticity on weed-crop competition.Objective 2 Hypotheses: We predict that 1) 15N uptake by maize will be reduced in the presence of weeds and soil resource spatial heterogeneity will alleviate the magnitude of this reduction; 2) increasing the number of N-rich patches and reducing the distance between maize and a patch will increase maize 15N uptake when in the presence of weeds; and 3) weed-maize combinations that include species with high foraging plasticity (as measured in Obj. 1) will compete less under conditions of high soil resource heterogeneity compared to weed-crop combinations with species that have low foraging plasticity.Objective 3: Determine the effects of cover crop residue spatial heterogeneity on the distribution and availability of soil resources, mycorrhizae colonization of roots, and weed-crop competition.Objective 3 Hypothesis: We expect that by increasing soil resource spatial heterogeneity through agricultural management we will see 1) increased aboveground biomass and lower R:S ratios of both maize and weeds in competition; 2) greater root system complementarity between crops and weeds; and 3) greater overall N capture by maize.","belowground competition, root foraging, soil heterogeneity, weed competition, weed ecology"

Recent evidence suggests that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics play an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. However, all our current understanding about the genetics and evolution of antibiotic-resistance is based on the selections of rare mutants with strong phenotypes when exposed to lethal concentrations of drugs. But this may not be the case under natural environments in which foodborne pathogenic bacteria may be frequently exposed to concentration gradients of antibiotics. Also, foodborne bacterial pathogens may be exposed to sublethal concentrations of various acids, alkali, heat or oxidative stress that may put selection pressure prior to antibiotic exposure. Under sublethal environments, any resistance mutations if induced are rapidly enriched upon coming in contact with low antibiotic concentrations which may lead a step-wide development of antibiotic resistance. Keeping this hypothesis in view, we will measure the degree and stability of increase or decrease in resistance in diverse strains of two foodborne bacterial pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella strains, against selected antibiotics after their exposure to sublethal acid, alkali, and oxidative stress environments prior to exposure to lethal antibiotics. This study will lead to important evidence on the role sublethal acid, alkali, oxidative and heat stress that may be prevalent in food production and processing environments on the emergence of antibiotic cross-resistance risk in foodborne bacterial pathogens. We will detect hypermutable clones that exhibit antibiotic resistance.On September 18, 2014, an executive order has been signed by the President of the United States on combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A new task force has been setup to detect, prevent, and control illness and death related to antibiotic-resistant infections by implementing measures that reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Our work will demonstrate the linkage between unintended mild stress exposure leading to antibiotic-resistant phenotypes of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella in food production and processing environments. Our work will determine the sublethal triggers for stress-hardened L. monocytogenes and Salmonella in high-risk serotypes that may lead to emergence of highly stable antibiotic resistance clones.

As a result, AMR costs the U.S. economy approximately $70 billion annually. In addition to clear threats to public health, AMR poses immediate challenges to the security of our agricultural economy because AMR can also decrease the effectiveness and diminish the availability of antimicrobials useful against bacteria that cause significant food-animal disease. Vibrant and effective public and animal-health systems depend on approaches to prevent and cure infectious diseases. Solutions to AMR are of paramount importance to the U.S.Worldwide, many have called for a wholesale reduction in the use of antimicrobials, citing evidence that there is either overuse or misuse of these products. In multiple jurisdictions, regulatory approaches to reduce &#39;overuse&#39; or &#39;misuse&#39; proceed either on the basis of defining what is not considered judicious use, point to scientific data supporting a prohibition order for a specified product (sometimes, a change in new drug approval processes, or else invoke the use of the precautionary principle to protect the efficacy of a product in the absence of firm scientific evidence.In the United States, several recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents of note, whose major purpose is to ensure the prudent approval and use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine and animal agriculture, have been published (e.g., Guidance for Industry (GFI) #152, #159, #209, and #213; to a major extent, these consist of non-binding recommendations). In 2003, GFI #152 established the risk assessment framework under which new animal drug approvals would proceed. This process included guidance to drug sponsors that qualitatively categorized antimicrobials as to criticality, but also established aspects of hazard, release, exposure, and consequence assessment that were previously less well defined for microbial hazards. A simplified framework for examining the risk of release of resistant bacteria and their determinants from agricultural facilities as part of a broader quantitative risk assessment framework presents a compelling opportunity to aim to achieve &#39;zero&#39; release of resistant bacteria (or determinants) above baseline or background risk levels. Since animal production can only take ownership of what is under its control this seems the logical place to start a discussion of what constitutes antimicrobial stewardship, and how this can be promoted into the future.Our overall long term goal is to identify, evaluate, and implement practical, effective and widely adoptable interventions for managing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among enteric bacteria; in this project, our focus is on developing - through a systems-based stakeholder-centered process - science-based voluntary stewardship programs suited to animal production. In pursuit of this overall goal we focus our efforts - herein on beef and dairy cattle production systems - and directly address the following supporting objectives in this proposal: 1) recruit key stakeholders to qualitatively explore the essential components and systems framework to maximize voluntary compliance with highly effective antimicrobial stewardship programs, 2) conduct empirical field studies to provide key microbiological, production, economic, and social science decision support data, 3) perform qualitative and quantitative modeling needed to design, test, and improve essential decision support tools, and 4) engage key stakeholders to further develop, refine and communicate highly effective decision support tools to enhance their voluntary adoption and diffusion and to maximize antimicrobial stewardship.Both AMR and the likelihood of unintended consequences of uninformed, broad-sweeping attempts to control it pose a direct threat to the sustainability of U.S. agriculture. In our integrated standard grant project, we will design, evaluate and deliver efficacious and implementable interventions to mitigate AMR, based on voluntary stewardship principles and guidelines, facilitated by science-based decision tools and multiple and broad stakeholder input and support.","Our overall long term goal is to identify, evaluate, and implement practical, effective and widely adoptable interventions for managing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among enteric bacteria.

PROJECT,GETTYSBURG COLLEGE,1008086,2016-69003-24615,Using CRISPR-SeroSeq to investigate Salmonella ecology and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance during poultry processing,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,128599.0,"Shariat, NI.",ACTIVE," Salmonella is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne illness in the United States. Since 2012, 31% of outbreaks have been poultry-related, accounting for 46% of salmonellosis cases. Thus Salmonella in poultry poses a major health concern to consumers, plus substantial economic loss for farmers and processors. The presence of antibiotic resistant strains further contributes to the medical financial burden (~$3.6 billion/year). Salmonella enterica, subspecies enterica can be separated into &gt;1500 different serovars, which can differ in pathogenicity and host colonization. Importantly, different serovars can also exhibit varied patterns of antibiotic resistance. Current routine surveillance for Salmonella during poultry processing only identifies the dominant serovar - that is the serovar that is in greater abundance - due to sampling limitations that include enrichment and isolation of one or two Salmonella-positive colonies. Such a singular approach lacks the resolution to detect rare/background serovars. Subsequently, antimicrobial resistance is only analyzed in dominant serovars. Since different serovars can exhibit different patterns of antimicrobial resistance, without recognizing the entire population of Salmonella in poultry samples, we are unable to determine the full extent of antimicrobial resistance. To effectively mitigate antimicrobial resistance, it is crucial to discern the extent to which elements that confer resistance exist within the Salmonella reservoir. Without a clear picture of serovar diversity plus corresponding profiles of antimicrobial resistance, current mitigation strategies may be futile. The extent of multiple serovars present throughout poultry processing is not known, though recent studies have showed that there are links between Salmonella found on the farm and in processing facilities and, furthermore, that multiple serovars have been detected in some broiler flocks. CRISPRs are dynamic genetic loci present in all Salmonella analyzed to date that, at the sequence level, show distinct serovar-specific patterns. CRISPR-SeroSeq is a molecular technology that exclusively combines the resolution and sensitivity of next-generation sequencing with the ability to identify individual Salmonella serovars based on their unique CRISPR DNA profiles. Thus, this approach will be able to detect background serovars present at several orders of magnitude lower than the dominant serovar. In this proposal, we intend to use CRISPR-SeroSeq to determine the population of serovars in samples at two different steps during poultry processing (before and after intervention). From a Salmonella surveillance perspective this molecular tool will provide the ability to scan complex samples and determine Salmonella diversity, at a higher resolution than has previously been possible. CRISPR-SeroSeq could also potentially be used to monitor to success of serovar-specific intervention techniques that may be used. Though such detection is useful in and of itself, our goal in this proposal extends further: we will utilize the sequence-specific serovar information contained within CRISPR sequences to reveal the antimicrobial resistance profiles of background serovars. Ultimately, we intend to determine population-wide antimicrobial resistance profiles by examining several samples during poultry processing. We expect our findings to be valuable when considering implementation of serovar-specific interventions as well as mitigation strategies for antimicrobial resistance in the poultry industry.","We plan to use CRISPR-SeroSeq, a novel and high-resolution molecular tool, to detect and identify all Salmonella serovars present in individual poultry samples without the need for isolation of individual colonies, and to investigate the presence of antibiotic resistance in these serovars.If successful, our molecular approach to identify all Salmonella serovars could be implemented into routine Salmonella surveillance protocols. Moreover, with regards to antibiotic resistance, this work will provide a population-wide understanding of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella, which will aid future mitigation strategies.The goals of this proposal are two-fold:1) To provide more accurate estimates as to the presence of background Salmonella serovars in chickens, from harvest through processing.2) To determine the prevalence of different antibiotic resistance patterns in background serovars.We have two specific aims to accomplish these goals, the objectives and proposed time required are listed below each specific aim.Specific Aim 1: Use CRISPR-SeroSeq to detect lesser prevalent Salmonella serovars poultry samples [Year 1]Objective 1.1 - Establish optimal conditions for CRISPR-SeroSeq PCR (two Students; Quarter 1-2).Objective 1.2 - Development of the CRISPR-SeroSeq bioinformatics pipeline (one Student; Quarter 2-3).Objective 1.3 - Test CRISPR-SeroSeq on poultry samples (three Students; Quarter 3-4).Specific Aim 2: Use CRISPR-SeroSeq to determine antibiotic resistance in background Salmonella serovars in chickens [Year 2]Objective 2.1 - Use CRISPR-SeroSeq to evaluate Salmonella serovar diversity in chickens during processing (three Students; Quarter 5-6).Objective 2.2 - Determine differential antibiotic resistance profiles in background and dominant serovars (three students; Quarter 6-8)","CRISPR-SeroSeq, antibiotic resistance, crispr, next-generation sequencing, salmonella, serotyping"

Recent research has attributed cases of elevated blood lead levels in children and, even fetal death, with the consumption of drinking water containing high levels of lead. Although the federal Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) strives to minimize lead exposure at water utilities through the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), an estimated 47 million U.S. residents reliant on private unregulated water systems (generally individual and rural) are not protected. In Virginia, 19% of private systems sampled had elevated lead, with concentrations as high as 24,740 &micro;g/L. For perspective, a lead concentration of 5,000 &micro;g/L or higher qualifies landfill leachate as hazardous waste. Although similar observations have been reported in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, detection, evaluation, and mitigation of lead in private systems is challenging due to lack of monitoring data, appropriate sampling protocols, and entities to fund research.The proposed research will address these knowledge gaps by investigating corrosion in private systems in North Carolina, which have been linked to several cases of childhood lead poisoning. The nature of the problem will be characterized using a lead profiling technique (i.e., sequential sampling) and forensic tools to identify lead-bearing plumbing sources. With an in-depth understanding of the sources of lead release within private systems and patterns of waterborne lead exposure, the effectiveness of existing remediation strategies can be evaluated, which is critical to mitigate the risks associated with waterborne lead exposure. This work will lead to procedures, protocols, and insights that can be applied in other systems, which will be disseminated in peer reviewed publications and outreach documents targeted at multiple stakeholders including well owners, health departments, and housing and community development departments.","Occurrence of contaminants in private water systems is increasingly recognized as a source of waterborne disease, with a rising trend in the proportion of waterborne disease outbreaks attributed to these systems since 1971 due to consumption of contaminated groundwater. Private systems with less than 15 service connections and serve less than 25 individuals for at least 60 days per year do not fall under the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) nor are they subject to the standards outlined in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Approximately 15% of U.S. households, serving more than 47 million residents, are reliant on private unregulated water systems.Preliminary efforts to survey water quality in private systems report that 23-58% of systems exceed at least one SDWA health-based drinking water standard, primarily for bacterial contamination. Contamination due to the corrosion of plumbing components is rarely assessed in private systems due to the lack regulations, suitable sampling protocols, and literature documenting serious problems. The very limited research to date on this subject has indicated that that 12-19% of private water systems exceed the EPA lead action level of 15 &micro;g/L. If these statistics are representative of private water quality nationally, 5.7-9.0 million private system residents are exposed to elevated lead in their drinking water.Under the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), the USEPA monitors and regulates waterborne lead concentrations in municipal systems by collecting ""first draw"" samples in consumers&#39; homes after a minimum of six hours of stagnation. If the ""action level"" of 15 &micro;g/L is exceeded, the municipality must implement corrosion control techniques such as addition of corrosion inhibitors and/or adjustments of water quality parameters to reduce lead leaching to water from plumbing. Use of these corrosion control strategies are not common in private systems, as only 8% of systems sampled in Virginia identified treatment devices that adjust water chemistry to control lead release or filter waterborne lead, which is worrisome given that some private systems can have extremely aggressive (i.e. corrosive) water. While the reported median pH and alkalinity in private wells nationally are relatively benign, certain aquifers have a median pH and alkalinity below 7.0 and 50 mg/L as CaCO3, respectively. This is in keeping with other studies that report 18-23% of private systems have a pH below the EPA recommended 6.5, which is well documented to cause problems with lead leaching.Despite the well-known adverse health effects and neurotoxicity, lead was still an additive to potable water plumbing components through January 2014, and as a result, virtually 100% of the existing rural housing stock is at risk for elevated lead in water. Furthermore, since the 1986 USEPA Lead Ban controls the allowable lead content in plumbing only in ""public water systems, or any plumbing in a residential facility...which is connected to a public water system"", the use of leaded and/or non-potable components in private systems is not uncommon and may even be occurring at present.The proposed research will advance knowledge of corrosion and public health protection in unregulated rural water systems. In order to mitigate the risks associated with waterborne lead exposure, this research will provide an in-depth understanding of the sources of lead release within private systems and examine the efficiency of current mechanical and chemical remediation strategies. The specific research objectives (1-3) include:Quantify the nature of waterborne lead release in private well households associated with childhood lead poisoning, and evaluate the plumbing source materials for the elevated lead; andExamine the short and long-term performance of common low-cost lead remediation strategies using synthesized water simulating private well water; andConduct a rigorous controlled lab study to compare the impact of commonly recommended chemical treatments on scaling, corrosion, microbial quality, well-infrastructure longevity, and examine the long-term benefits and detriments of such practices.","corrosion, drinking water, rural health, Lead, well water"

It has been difficult to automate these tasks because specialty farms are much less structured environments when compared to commodity farms. However, there is a great need for automating specialty crop tasks because seasonal workers are costly and in short supply and collecting data for precision agriculture methods is difficult. Robotic systems capable of performing specialty crop tasks are becoming commercially available, more robust and affordable. What is missing are planning algorithms required for these robots to autonomously operate in complex environments such as apple orchards. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop algorithms so that Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) robot systems can be used in automation tasks involving specialty crops.The project will focus on two sets of problems: (1) Surveying problems require planning the trajectory of a sensor to collect information about objects of interest. Such sensor planning problems in three-dimensional, complex environments are provably hard. The proposed work introduces new sensor planning problems in environments which are both general enough to capture the complexity of objects encountered on small farms (e.g., trees), and sufficiently constrained so that their visibility properties can be exploited to design efficient algorithms. (2) For end-effector placement, we introduce new visual servoing path planning techniques utilizing multiple arms for operation in cluttered environments with obstacles, such as the branches of a fruit tree.These algorithms will be implemented and tested in the context of two field studies involving quality inspection with near infra-red (NIR) sensors mounted on a COTS robotic manipulator and surveying to collect harvest related data. These studies, combined with the surveying and servoing algorithms, open possibilities for developing new metrics, tools and techniques for agricultural sciences by enabling data collection in scales not possible for humans.","The goal of this project is to develop planning algorithms for robots to autonomously operate in complex environments such as apple orchards so that Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) robot systems can be used in automation tasks involving specialty crops.The project will focus on two sets of problems: (1) Surveying problems require planning the trajectory of a sensor to collect information about objects of interest.

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,1007747,2016-67017-24461,"Diet, gut microbiota, and butyrate: investigting the epigenetic mechanism that prevents colorectal inflammation and tumorigenesis",National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499741.0,"Bultman, SC, J.",ACTIVE,"Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this application is to understand how the combination of dietary fiber and gut microbiota confer a protective effect so that probiotic and prebiotic approaches can be implemented. Furthermore, our gut microbiome is being implicated in many aspects of human health, and this work will establish a role for our gut microbiota in colorectal cancer prevention as well as an epigenetic mechanism involving the microbial metabolite butyrate acting as a histone deacetylase inhibitor.","Long-Term Goals, Central Hypothesis, and Supporting ObjectivesWhether dietary fiber protects against colorectal cancer (CRC) has been controversial because of conflicting results from human epidemiologic studies. However, these studies and mouse models of CRC have not controlled the composition of gut microbiota, which ferment fiber into short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate. Butyrate is noteworthy because it has energetic and epigenetic functions in colonocytes and tumor-suppressive properties in CRC cell lines. We recently developed a gnotobiotic mouse model of CRC colonized with wild-type or mutant strains of a butyrate-producing bacterium to demonstrate that fiber does have a potent tumor-suppressive effect but in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner. The next challenge is to characterize the mechanism of tumor suppression. Our overarching hypothesis is that the fiber-microbiota-butyrate axis epigenetically regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation in both neoplastic colonocytes and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Although butyrate is a well-known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, the target genes important for tumor suppression in vivo have yet to be identified. It also is not known whether the source of dietary fiber is a significant factor or if other bioactive food components can interact with fiber and butyrate to increase the efficacy of tumor suppression. To address these gaps in our knowledge and achieve the objectives of this application, we propose an experimental plan that includes the following Aims:Aim 1: Characterize fiber-microbiota-butyrate induced changes in histone acetylation and gene expression during tumor suppression. Germfree mice will be colonized with specific gut microbiota, including either a wild-type or mutant strain of butyrate-producing bacterium, while maintained in gnotobiotic isolators. These mice will receive control (low-fiber) or high-fiber diets and will be treated with AOM/DSS (azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate) to induce colorectal tumors. ChIP-seq will be used to identify histone acetylation profiles for every gene in the genome. H3K9ac and H3K27ac will be analyzed because they are highly enriched at gene promoters and enhancers of transcribed genes, respectively. H3K27ac is also a marker of variant enhancer loci that differ between normal colonic tissue and CRC in human clinical samples. These epigenomic data will be integrated with transcriptome profiles obtained from the same samples using RNA-seq. In addition to normal colonic tissues and colorectal tumors, flow-sorted immune cells within the tumor microenvironment will be analyzed because tumor suppression could be mediated, in part, through decreased inflammation.Aim 2: Determine the relative importance of the fiber-microbiota-butyrate axis in anti-inflammatory-mediated tumor suppression. Butyrate is known to have anti-inflammatory effects, and we hypothesize that this contributes to tumor suppression. Gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacteria that ferment fiber into either low or high levels of butyrate will be treated with AOM alone or AOM/DSS to induce colorectal tumors. The former is associated with less inflammation than the latter, and this comparison will provide insight into whether the protective effect is linked to inflammation. Additionally, for the AOM/DSS model, the tumor burden of wild-type mice will be compared to RAG-2- and IL-10-deficient mice because their immune responses are modulated in opposite directions. RAG-2 mutants lack functional T cells and B cells and have a diminished immune response, whereas IL-10 mutants lack a crucial immunosuppressive cytokine and have an aberrantly heighted immune response. The RAG-2-deficient mice will interrogate the function of T cells and B cells in tumor suppression, and this is expected to complement the histone acetylation and transcriptome studies on these cells in Aim 1. IL-10-deficient mice are particularly relevant to our experimental design because IL-10 regulates the inflammatory response of immune cells to commensal bacteria in the colon. Tumors will be characterized histopathologically and using markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The immune response will be analyzed by flow cytometry and multiplexed biomarker assays for 50 cytokines/chemokines.Aim 3: Evaluate different sources of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids in tumor suppression. First, we will compare two sources of dietary fiber in our gnotobiotic mouse model of CRC. We hypothesize that fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)/inulin will have a stronger tumor-suppressive effect than wheat bran because the former is fermented by gut microbiota to a greater extent than the latter. Second, we will investigate whether omega-3 fatty acids increase the efficacy of the fiber-microbiota-butyrate axis in tumor suppression. Our gnotobiotic mouse model of CRC will be provided two omega-3 fatty acids, alone or in combination with a high-fiber diet. Based on our preliminary studies in CRC cell lines, our hypothesis is that a diet where fiber/butyrate and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are combined will have a stronger protective effect than either bioactive food component alone. Our cell line data suggest that another omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), will not interact with fiber and butyrate to the same extent. To address mechanism, we will assess whether DHA influences butyrate metabolism or if it has a significant effect on inflammation. The former will be accomplished by measuring intracellular butyrate concentrations by LC-MS, while the latter will be investigated by flow cytometry and multiplexed biomarker assays for 50 cytokines/chemokines.","butyrate, colorectal cancer, dietary fiber, inflammation, microbiome"

Evidence indicates that AOPPs play a crucial role in aging-associated bone loss and suggests that the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods may lower the risk of aging-associated osteoporosis by reducing AOPPs. Our preliminary studies with cell and animal models have shown that blackcurrant or its anthocyanin-rich extract is effective in reducing bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. However, the animal model used might not adequately mimic the conditions of aging-associated bone loss coupled with menopause that exist in middle-aged and older women. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of antioxidants on the formation of AOPPs in vivo still remain unknown.

The proposed research is designed to answer an important question of whether, and if so how, long-term berry consumption reduces aging-associated bone loss in this mouse model of aging. Thus, this proposed study is an important step toward discovering potential dietary agents that may be effective in preventing bone loss.

There is a critical need to identify metabolic or genetic factors that can predispose dairy cows to develop fatty liver. Our long-term goal is to understand the onset and progression of fatty liver disease and to develop targeted prevention strategies. Our central hypothesis is that adiponutrin regulates lipid metabolism in the liver and that decreased adiponutrin activity increases susceptibility to lipid accumulation. Our objectives are to 1) evaluate adiponutrin mRNA and protein expression in control and induced fatty liver transition cows; 2) determine regulation of adiponutrin mRNA and protein by fatty acids and elucidate the role of adiponutrin in triglyceride accumulation in primary hepatocytes using mRNA silencing; and 3) determine if mutations in the adiponutrin gene are linked to different hepatic lipid infiltration phenotypes. We expect that cows with fatty liver will have decreased adiponutrin expression during fatty liver onset and that on a larger scale, cows with greater liver lipids after calving will have mutations in adiponutrin that will decrease protein activity. We also anticipate that fatty acids will regulate adiponutrin expression and that when adiponutrin is knocked down chemically, there will be more lipid accumulation. Elucidating the regulation of adiponutrin will highlight potential interventions to improve liver efficiency and prevent fatty liver, and potentially provide a tool to identify cows predisposed to fatty liver.","Ourcentral hypothesisis that adpn regulates hepatic lipolysis in dairy cattle and that decreased adpn activity increases susceptibility to lipid accumulation. We have formulated this hypothesis based on the similarities in the etiology and progression between human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and bovine fatty liver. Extensive sequence homology between the bovine and human adiponutrin coding regions suggests that function and regulation of adpn in bovine and human are similar. The goals of this projectare to determine the role of adpn in regulating hepatic TG storage in dairy cattle, determine regulation of adpn by fatty acids, and to evaluate the phenotypic relationship between adpn expression, SNP presence, and hepatic lipid infiltration.

Small intestinal digestion of starch is very poor in cattle in comparison to many nonruminants (e.g., pigs, humans, mice), and almost one-third of the energy absorbed from small intestinal starch digestion contributes to omental (i.e., belly) fat accretion, which provides little benefit in production of beef or milk. Greater flow of high-quality protein (i.e., casein) or a specific amino acid (i.e., glutamic acid) can increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle; however, little is known about how greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion or potential impacts on beef or milk production. We hypothesize that greater flows of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by different mechanisms in cattle and that apparent influences on beef production will differ. This project will allow greater understanding of how increased absorption of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion by directly measuring pancreatic and small intestinal enzymes that can limit small intestinal starch digestion in cattle. Additionally, this project will provide insight to the potential value of increasing small intestinal starch digestion in cattle by greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid by measuring increases in dietary energy (i.e., retained energy) and quantify fates in the body from starch digested in the small intestine. It is likely that the mechanisms that increase small intestinal starch digestion in response to greater postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid differ and differences may have large impacts on dietary energy retained by cattle. Additionally, amounts of digested starch used for omental fat accretion may be less when small intestinal starch digestion is increased in response to greater small intestinal flows of casein or glutamic acid. Greater knowledge of how postruminal flow of casein or glutamic acid increase small intestinal starch digestion in cattle and subsequent impacts on beef production may allow for broader application of diets that can increase efficiency of beef production in the United States.","A major goal of this project is to improve knowledge of post-absorptive and metabolic effects among cattle with increased small intestinal starch digestion in response to to greater postruminal flows of glutamic acid or casein.

Because the limited amount of fixed nitrogen very often limits plant growth, these associations often occupy foundational positions in natural ecosystems and are very important in traditional forms of agriculture. Increasing the utility of nitrogen-fixing symbioses is one way of changing the current dependence of agriculture on industrial nitrogen fertilizers, a practice that generates a number of types of pollution, from soil acidity to atmospheric greenhouse gas generation and ozone destruction. Establishing an effective symbiosis requires the development of root nodules, unique symbiotic organs in which the specialized metabolism of nitrogen fixation, nitrogen assimilation and transport can take place. Both the plant and bacteria change during nodule development. Recent work has shown that members of the CspA family of bacterial RNA binding proteins are highly regulated during symbiotic development. The CspA family is named for the archetypal Cold Shock Proteins, but it is clear that the striking changes in CspA family gene expression during nodule development are not a response to cold stress and suggests instead that their induction/repression is a programmed way of controlling gene expression. In preliminary studies we have found that the set of RNAs that co-purified with different Sinorhizobium meliloti CspA homologs after heterologous expression in E. coli were distinct and were significantly enriched for regulatory RNA sequences containing base paired stem-loop structures. These data support a hypothesis in which riboregulation mediated by different CspA family proteins participates in symbiotic development through their interaction with specific stress or environmentally responsive RNAs. We will specifically address what RNA molecules CspA proteins modulate and how CspA function influences gene expression during symbiosis. Achievement of the proposed aims will begin to define mechanisms of CspA homolog function in rhizobia and expand the current understanding of gene regulation and stress response mechanisms in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Application of this understanding is critical in ameliorating the financial and environmental cost of industrial nitrogen fertilizer use and is essential to meet future agricultural needs.",The goal of this project is to further the understanding of symbiotic nitrogen fixation by elucidating the mechanism of CspA mediated riboregulation as it relates to changes in bacterial development during the maturation of the symbiotic relationship between nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and legumes. To achieve this goal we will employ the following specific aims:1. Establishing connections between CspA family members and potential target RNAs.2. Determining how CspA proteins influence symbiosis and gene expression.3.

PROJECT,"BOYCE THOMPSON INSTITUTE FOR PLANT RESEARCH, I",1007949,2016-67013-24464,Increasing Rubisco abundance in maize to modify plant performance,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,459950.0,"Stern, DA, B..",ACTIVE,"Plants incorporate atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars, a process that ultimately sustains all life on Earth. In agriculture, CO2fixation is a longstanding target for improvement, because doing so could increase yield and reduce environmental impacts of farming through reduced water and fertilizer consumption. This project is based on novel lines of maize that were created, that have a more than 50% increase in the amount of theoretical CO2fixation capacity. These lines were found to have a marked resilience to chilling stress, because in maize chilling stress has a strong negative effect on photosynthesis. Thus, these modifications appear to improve maize tolerance to an important climaticstress. Theproposed work focuses on chilling stress, comparing performance of different maize lines under several chilling regimes at the seedling or grain-filling stages. Plants will be characterized at a molecular level, and whole plant performance will be assessed for photosynthetic parameters, biomass and grain yield. The lines will also be tested in response to water or heat stress, which is often encountered in the field. Together, the results may offer an avenue for improving crop performance under both stress and non-stress conditions.","The major goal of this project is to exploit existing transgenic maize lines that possess higher than normal abundance of the carbon dioxide-fixing enzyme Rubisco. Early results suggest that some of these lines are unusually tolerant to chilling stress, and one goal is to understand this tolerance mechanistically. Another goal is to find whether the novel properties of these lines confer altered tolerance to other stresses, or even confer a potential yield advantage under conditions that might be found during growth in the field. To achieve these goals, the following objectives are proposed:Transgenic and control line performanceswill be compared under several chilling regimes at the seedling or grain-filling stages. This will include molecular analysis of Rubisco-related gene expression, genome-wide RNA analysis, and physiological parameters such as photosynthesis, biomass and grain yield.Transgenic and control line performances will be compared upon exposure to water or heat stress, both of which are often encountered in agriculture.Currently, best-performing lines under chilling stress express additional Rubisco subunits and at least one Rubisco assembly factor through transgenes. New transgenic lines have been received with additional expression of a new Rubisco assembly factor called RAF2. We will determine whether RAF2 overexpression has any effect on the properties of maize plants as related to this proposal (i.e. chilling, heat or water stress).","abiotic stress, c4, carbon dioxide, maize, photosynthesis, rubisco"

This project examines the role of the gas nitric oxide (NO) in regulating key soil microbial activities, such as nitrogen cycling, microbial desiccation tolerance and soil aggregate stability. These soil microbial activities are central for terrestrial ecosystems as they control nutrient and water availability in these systems. NO is a product and a regulator of denitrification and nitrification, microbial processes that are important components of the nitrogen cycle; however NO can also control other distinct microbial activities such as biofilm formation. Microorganisms form biofilms, composed of hydroscopic extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), in some cases, as protective habitats against desiccation. In soil, EPS can increase aggregate stability and soil water holding capacity. The hypothesis central to this work is that NO in the soil atmosphere regulates N-processing as well as increasing microbial desiccation tolerance and soil aggregate stability via EPS production. To examine this hypothesis, microbial isolates and soil samples will be exposed to controlled concentrations of NO and analyzed for nitrogen cycling activities, EPS production, desiccation tolerance and soil aggregate stability.","Goals1.

Although traditional selection methods have significantly improved animal performance in both dairy and beef cattle, the genetic potential for whole genome selection remains relatively untapped. In particular, knowledge and technologies for genomic improvement of meat quality, animal fertility and innate resistance to pathogens are limited because these traits are either difficult to measure and/or have low heritability. Research has shown that many genes have more than one transcriptional end, resulting in functional diversities and dynamics. In the proposed project, we will use our newly developed next generation sequencing method to detect usage of gene transcriptional ends specific to those complex phenotypes described above. We believe our research explores novel molecular mechanisms underlying these economically important traits for real, efficient and effective solutions to advance marker-assisted selection in cattle. Selection of animals who express key genes that influence beef tenderness, palatability, flavor and healthfulness would help gain consumer confidence in beef products. In addition, the novel mechanisms governing host-pathogen interactions discovered in the proposed project would aid in development of effective alternative, non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, thus addressing societal concerns by preventing the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria in lactating dairy cows.","The 3&#39; untranslated regions (3&#39;UTRs) of mRNAs are defined as the sequences located directly after stop codons.

P. nodorum is one of several necrotrophic pathogens (pathogens that feed on newly killed tissue) that affect wheat and wheat relatives. In the Northern Great Plains, consistent yield losses of 5-10% due to SNB occur, generating losses in the Northern Great Plains of more than a billion dollars in the last decade. For breeders, SNB has been a difficult problem to overcome due to the lack of understanding of the underlying basis of the disease. Rarely have major resistance genes been identified, however, many minor quantitative genes that contribute to the overall disease have been identified.Given the decreased cost of DNA sequencing, we are combining next generation sequencing technology and genome wide association mapping, a technology driven by intractable genetic systems, most prominently human and animal systems, to identify genomic regions contributing to SNB of wheat. Additionally, we would like to understand the basic biology of how necrotrophic pathogen-produced proteins (necrotrophic effectors) are triggering cell death, and how this class of pathogens is using these effector proteins to avoid or protect from the effects of the host innate immune system.The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how necrotrophic pathogens interact with their corresponding hosts.

PROJECT,VET - OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY-SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,1008586,2016-67015-24734,The Effect Of Visual Seclusion And Stocking Density On The Behavior And Welfare Of Transition Dairy Cows,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Proudfoot, KA, L..",ACTIVE,"Despite decades of nutritional and epidemiological research, dairy cows remain at high risk of disease after giving birth. A main gap in our knowledge is the optimal housing environment for these vulnerable animals, which would require a fundamental understanding of cow behavior and preferences at calving. When kept on range, cows will leave the herd to find a secluded environment to give birth. This preference is retained in indoor-housed cows housed individually; yet, many cows in the United States are kept in high-density groups at calving, with limited ability to hide. Our overall goal is to provide dairy producers with recommendations for optimal calving environments. Our first objective is to determine the detailed calving behavior of cows kept on pasture, including their preference for visual seclusion and distance from herdmates. Cows will be kept on a 4.3-acre pasture equipped with video cameras and multiple areas to hide. Our second objective is to determine if high stocking density in an indoor group pen increases stress and restricts natural calving behavior. Our third objective is to determine if the provision of a visual hide in an indoor pen can reduce stress and facilitate more natural calving behaviors. To reach these objectives, cows will be housed at high and low stocking densities, with and without a hide. Results from this project will create foundational knowledge about the natural calving behavior of dairy cows, as well as practical and novel housing recommendations for dairy producers to improve the welfare of their animals at calving.","Animal welfare is a key social concern that must be addressed to safeguard the future viability of the dairy industry (von Keyserlingk et al., 2013). Concerns over the quality of life of animals include their biological health, freedom from experiencing unpleasant states like pain and distress, and the ability to perform natural behaviors (Fraser et al., 1997; OIE, 2010). The most critical period in the life of a dairy cow is when she gives birth, as she must cope with painful labor in conjunction with diet changes, the onset of lactation, separation from her calf, social regroupings, and novel environments over a period of a few days. Cows unable to cope with these challenges succumb to disease after calving, significantly impairing their welfare and the overall profitability of the herd.Decades of research focused on understanding biological changes that a cow undergoes during the onset of lactogenesis. This, in turn, has led to development of nutritional strategies designed to meet the needs of a dairy cow during this transition period, generally defined as the 3 wk before and after parturition (Grummer, 1995; Overton and Waldron, 2004). Despite the clear advancements made with this research, the reported incidence of transition cow diseases has remained relatively static (USDA, 2008), suggesting that an alternative approach is required.Over the last 10 years, researchers at the William H. Miner Institute (where the co-PD conducted his PhD research) and the University of British Columbia&#39;s Animal Welfare Program (where the PD conducted her PhD research) have focused on developing a comprehensive understanding of cow behavior during the transition period. This research has provided valuable insight into a cow&#39;s ability to successfully cope transition. For example, cows at-risk of metritis and ketosis after calving consume less feed and avoid social competition up to 3 wk before becoming ill, suggesting that these cows may be negatively affected by social stressors caused by limited resources. Further research determined that increasing the stocking density of the feeding area before and after calving can significantly increase competition, as well as change the normal feeding pattern of cows during transition (Proudfoot et al., 2009; Krawczel et al., 2009).To date, this behavioral research has primarily focused on cow behavior during the few weeks before and after calving; less research has evaluated the experience of the cow during the acute period around labor. Dr. Proudfoot&#39;s PhD research discovered that indoor-housed Holstein cows retain some of their natural instincts as they prepare to give birth. On range, beef and dairy cows leave the herd to seek out a secluded area to calve, such as tree cover or tall grass (Lidfors et al., 1994). Using 2 experiments, Proudfoot et al. (2014ab) determined that when given the choice indoors, individually-housed Holstein cows also prefer a quiet, secluded environment to calve.This novel finding has deepened our understanding of transition cow behavior, but also left many questions unresolved. For example, it is unclear how to adapt this finding to a commercial setting where cows are often housed in groups at calving (USDA, 2008) with limited access to separate from herdmates. It is also unclear how management practices such as stocking density can affect a cow&#39;s ability to find seclusion and express natural calving behaviors. Thus, the proposed research project aims to further develop our knowledge about the natural behavior of dairy cows at calving by collecting detailed behavioral data from cows kept on pasture. We also aim to apply this knowledge to an indoor setting by assessing how the provision of space allowance (i.e., stocking density) and the opportunity to hide impacts stress, the ability to calve normally, and overall health. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to provide dairy producers with evidence-based recommendations for transition cow management and housing strategies that improve animal welfare and overall sustainability of the dairy industry. Specific objectives:Objective 1.Determine the detailed behavior of dairy cows before giving birth and preference for inter-cow distance and visual seclusion.We expect that dairy cattle kept on pasture will instinctively leave the herd and find either natural (tree/brush) or man-made visual hide from the herd at approximately 8 hours before giving birth. Cow behavior in the few hours before calving will differ significantly from their behavior during the previous 3 wk.Objective 2.Determine theeffectof stocking density on the behavior and health of indoor-housed dairy cows at calving.We expect that the provision of space willwillreduce stress and accommodate more natural calving behaviors. Specifically, we predict that cows housed at high stocking densities (9.7 to 12.9 m2 per cow) will be less flexible in their behavior during labor, and will show higher physiological indicators of stress (fecal cortisol metabolites)andpoor health (higher NEFA and haptoglobin) before and after calving compared to those housed at low stocking density (19.4 to 25.8 m2 per cow).Objective 3.Determine the effect of visual seclusionon the behavior and health of indoor-housed dairy cows at calving. We predict that cows housed in a pen with a hide will preferentially use the hidewhen giving birth, thereby accommodating more natural calving behaviors. We also anticipate that the provision of a hide will buffer the negative effects of high stocking density, reducing physiological indicators of stress and poor health.By accomplishing these objectives, we are directly addressing the Animal Well-Being program priority to determine behavioral and physiological methods to objectively measure animal stress and well-being, and to prevent or alleviate pain or stress associated with management practices, including stocking density. To our knowledge, this will be one of the first research projects to describe the detailed behavioral repertoire of dairy cows kept in a natural setting when giving birth. This information will provide valuable foundational knowledge for future research aimed at developing appropriate housing and management strategies for transition dairy cows kept both indoors and outdoors.","behavior, dairy cow, welfare, calving"

Given this threat, we must understand the evolutionary and ecological relationships between forest trees and insect communities in order to make the best conservation and management decisions. These decisions are critical for the continued survival of our forested ecosystems, which we depend on for aesthetic, economic and ecological reasons (e.g., hunting, fishing, timber, park lands, air and water quality). Populus tremuloides is the most widespread forest tree species in North America and is a foundational species in many ecosystems. However, it has shown signs of decline in many places across the continent as well as being subject to attacks by leaf-feeding insects. One way to address this issue is to have a better understanding of the genetic basis of what makes these trees more or less susceptible to insect attacks. Improved genetic understanding can lead to improved management or adaptive breeding.Recent, significant advances in our ability to sequence plant genomes has made it possible to better understand genetic mechanisms that underlie plant-insect interactions. Specifically we can use association mapping, which allows for the correlation of phenotypic traits (e.g., plant growth and chemical defense; insect abundance and diversity) to genomic regions (e.g., genes). This method has become a principal tool to identify what genes are responsible for observable phenotypes, but has rarely been applied to forest insect systems. The Populus species represent the first model tree species and consequently have a great deal of genomic resources available. These resources coupled with the fact that Populus tremuloides is an ecologically and economically important tree species that has many associated insect species, make it an ideal system to study.

Powdered foods are widely used as ingredients in manufacturing processed foods or consumed directly by humans and animals for their energy and nutrient contents. Inappropriate and insufficient decontamination have led to numerous outbreaks of foodborne diseases in recent years. Different physical and chemical processes have been used to decontaminate powdered foods. However, these processes have various defects, making their application ineffective and sometime impractical. IPL is an emerging technology for overcoming these defects. In this project, a continuous IPL process will be investigated for its germicidal effectiveness and also its impacts on physical, chemical, nutritional, and sensory properties of representative powdered foods. A prototype IPL system will be designed and constructed through the consultations with industry partners and stakeholders. The research activities on the system will cover the process optimization in lab and the field trials with industry partners, while the extension activities will include the workshop to demonstrate its usage to the stakeholders. Overall, we expect this technology platform will cost-effectively improve the safety of powdered foods and reduce the occurance of foodborne diseases asscoiated with the consumption of powdered food.

Both species are susceptible to cold and freezing damage (sorghum even more so than maize), which restricts the length of the growing season for each species. Shorter growing seasons provide less total opportunity for photosynthesis, which restricts the ability of plant breeders to increase yields. However, many other species can tolerate cold temperatures, and with acclimation can even tolerate short periods of freezing temperatues.

Runner formation is one way plants undergo rapid asexual propagation. Almost all strawberry plants grown in large commercial farms or small home gardens are propagated through runners instead of seeds. There are numerous advantages to this method of propagation, including the capacity to maintain superior genotypes that would not breed true through sexual reproduction, freedom from the requirement of pollinators, and faster cycling time.During development, strawberry axillary meristems can develop into either runners or flowering shoots; these two alternative developmental fates are mutually exclusive and regulated by environmental and hormonal factors. While more runners are desired by nurseries to produce more plantlets for planting, more floral shoots are desired by growers to yield fruit. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of how the axillary meristems choose between ""runner"" vs. ""flowering shoot"" is not known. No gene that specifically confers runner fate has been identified, nor there is detailed molecular or morphological description of runner meristem initiation and development. The proposed work is aimed at providing knowledge in these unknown areas. Specifically,we will characterize and describe both morphologically and molecularly the development of the runner meristem. We will isolate the Runnergene taking advantage of the naturally occurring runnerless cultivars. We will also isolate a second gene, whose mutationconverts the ""runnerless"" cultivar into a runner-making cultivar. The isolated genes will be examined in other non-runner species such as Arabidopsis to test if they are present and if they can promote or suppress runner formation via transgenic means.If a ""runner"" gene can be isolated and manipulated to enable controlled switches between ""runner"" vs. ""flowering shoot"" fates, it will dramatically improve strawberry productivity and yield. Further, if such a runner gene can be introduced into other non-runner crop species to enable runner-based clonal propagation, it could revolutionize crop propagation and agricultural practice and productivity.","The major goalsof this project are to characterize the strawberry runner meristem, profile runner meristem transcriptome, and isolate the Runner gene usingthe mapping-by-sequencing approach.","strawberry, Asexual propagation, gene isolation, runner"

The diversity, structure, and function of soil microbial communities are affected by many factors such as climate, livestock grazing, manure application, and tillage. Numerous studies have investigated microbe-climate interactions at laboratory and in-situ plot scales, however, few studies to date have investigated microbe-climate interactions across multiple spatial (e.g., laboratory, plot, ecosystem/landscape) and temporal (e.g., hourly, daily, seasonally) scales under livestock grazing and manure application.Intellectual Merits:The research component of this integrated project will develop and apply a multi-scale and integrated observation and modeling framework to address the major scientific questions relevant to microbe-climate interactions. The overall research goal is to improve our understanding of and to model microbe-climate interactions in grazed lands and manure-applied croplands across various spatial-temporal scales. The supporting research objectives are (1) to quantify the role of microbial community diversity, structure, and function on CO2, N2O, and CH4 (GHG) emissions from grasslands and winter wheat croplands; (2) to develop and improve the microbial processes sub-model (DNDC) to estimate GHG emissions; and (3) to apply the plant-soil-microbe models (DNDC) to estimate GHG emissions across landscape and watershed scales. The multi-scale observation will be implemented at the integrated grassland and cropland observation sites in Oklahoma, where GHG fluxes are measured with instruments at eddy covariance tower, static and automated soil chambers. Microbial community diversity, structure, and functions will also be analyzed simultaneously using high throughput functional gene array and sequencing technologies at those plots with static and automated soil chambers under various conditions of climate (rainfall), livestock grazing and manure application.The education component of this integrated project will develop and implement a multi-level and cross-disciplinary education framework to address the major education questions relevant to the human capacity for agriculture. The overall goal of the proposed education project is to improve and expand the human capacity in understanding the results from agricultural research, using relevant results for agricultural practice and decision making, and participating in agricultural research and education.

The underlying hypothesis of the proposed research is that photosensitizers dissolved in wash water will produce free radicals when exposed to UV (254 nm) light. These free radicals will act synergistically with the UV to enhance microbial inactivation rate. This hypothesis is based on literature and our prior studies. UV processing is an attractive technology for bacterial and viral inactivation. However, its limited depth of penetration and non-homogeneous treatment due to rough and contoured shape of produce has impeded its use in produce industry. Conventional chlorine and hydrogen peroxide based sanitizers used for washing produce have significant limitations such as limited microbial inactivation and ineffectiveness in destroying internalized bacteria and viruses. The proposed approach addresses these limitations. The specific objectives are- (1) Investigate the chemical nature of free radicals generated from UV exposure of fructose and gallic acid and determine the factors that impact their rate of generation, (2) Investigate the efficacy of proposed approach in inactivating bacteria and viruses in liquid medium, produce surface and internalized within produce using novel imaging based approaches and (3) identify the impact of proposed technology on quality of fresh produce. Successful development of this novel technology will lead to a cost effective method for improved sanitation of fresh produce with extended shelf-life.","Non-thermal food processing technologies have demonstrated potential to inactive pathogens in food systems while maintaining the nutritional and quality attributes of the food and achieving significant efficiency in energy consumption. Among various non-thermal technologies, UV based technologies have made a significant impact on decontamination of processing equipment, process waste water and packaging materials with annual sale of UV decontamination equipment nearing 1 billion dollars. Although UV technology has significant potential for reducing microbial load in food systems, particularly beverage products and fresh produce, its application has been limited due to challenges of low penetration depth of UV light in a food matrix (0.1- 1 cm depending upon nature of food matrix). This research proposal aims to address this significant limitation by evaluating the synergistic combination of novel, food-grade photosensitizers (fructose and gallic acid) and UV-C light (254 nm) to improve the microbial (bacterial and viral) inactivation rate in wash water and fresh produce. The underlying hypothesis of the proposed research is that photosensitizers dissolved in aqueous media will produce free radicals when exposed to UV-C (254 nm). These free radicals will act synergistically along with the UV light to enhance the rate of microbial inactivation in wash water and on surface and within fresh produce. This hypothesis is supported by the current literature, our previous studies and preliminary data that demonstrate that exposure of photosensitizers to UV light results in generation of oxidizing free radicals. Extensive prior work shows that microorganisms are susceptible to death by interaction with free radicals such as hydroxyl, acyl, peroxyl, hydroxyalkyl and superoxide radicals through diverse mechanisms such as damage to nucleic acid, proteins and lipids. In our preliminary study, we showed that fructose accelerated quenching of fluorescein, a free radical sensitive fluorescent dye, in presence of UV light (254 nm) indicating generation of free radicals. Prior studies show that these free radicals could be hydroxyalkyl, acyl, or peroxyl radicals. Another study showed that gallic acid exhibited strong antimicrobial activity exclusively in the presence of UV light, possibly through formation of oxidizing free radicals. Therefore, it is expected that generation of oxidizing free radicals coupled with antimicrobial action of UV itself will increase the rate of microbial inactivation compared to UV processing alone. The specific objectives of this proposed research are-Investigate free radicals generation from novel photosensitizers (fructose and gallic acid) upon exposure to UV light in aqueous solutions and a model 3-dimensional solid systemEvaluate efficacy of simultaneous action of photosensitizers and UV exposure on bacterial and viral inactivation in aqueous medium and fresh produce (surface and internalized)Measure the impact of proposed approach on quality of fresh produce","food quality, fresh produce, non-thermal, photosensitizers, ultraviolet"

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,1008769,2016-67013-24763,Structure-based discovery of nematicides targeting phosphodiesterase enzymes in phytoparasitic nematodes,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,149800.0,"Cote, RI, H..",ACTIVE,"Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major cause of reduced agricultural productivity ($80-$100 billion in crop damage annually). Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are particularly widespread and account for ~5% of all damage. Our long-term goal is to identify novel compounds that effectively target root-knot nematodes without adverse consequences to plants or other animals. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that degrade cyclic nucleotides. Many family-specific inhibitor compounds for PDEs have been developed for therapeutic uses in humans. Phytoparasitic nematodes possess genes that are orthologous to vertebrate PDEs, whereas higher plants do not possess PDEs. Our central hypothesis is that differences in the structure of nematode PDEs compared to vertebrate PDEs will be reflected in altered pharmacological properties that will allow the development of highly targeted and potent nematicides. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the pharmacological properties of PDE inhibitors toward nematode PDEs, and to use this information to conduct molecular docking studies for structure-based nematicide discovery. The outcomes of this hypothesis-driven Strengthening Seed Grant address a priority of the Plant-Associated Insects and Nematodes program to develop pest management approaches for the control of plant parasitic nematodes. This work is an important step in the design of next-generation nematicides that target phytoparasitic nematodes without adverse effects on plants and other animals. Such compounds would benefit U.S. agriculture by reducing crop damage, improving the sustainability of farming operations, enhancing food security, and eliminating adverse environmental and public health impacts associated with traditional nematicides.","The long term goal is to discover a new class of nematicides targeting nematode PDEs that lack toxicity for other organisms. The objectives are to evaluate the pharmacological properties of PDE inhibitors toward nematode PDEs, and to conduct molecular docking studies for structure-based nematicide discovery.Objective 1: Characterize the pharmacological properties of nematode PDE catalytic domains.Our working hypothesis is that observed differences between nematode and vertebrate PDE catalytic domain amino acid sequences will result in altered sensitivity of nematode PDEs for compounds originally designed to inhibit an individual human PDE family.Both C. elegansand M. haplacontain six orthologs of the vertebrate PDE families: PDE1, PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE8, and PDE10. We propose to characterize the pharmacological properties of both M. hapla and C. elegans PDE catalytic domains and compare them to their human orthologs. C. elegans PDEs are included in this study for two reasons: (1) characterizing differences in the inhibitor binding pocket of M. hapla and C. elegans PDEs may eventually lead to discovery of compounds that have reduced toxicity for free-living soil nematodes compared to phytoparasitic nematodes; (2) C. elegans is more easily cultured in the lab, thus allowing rapid phenotypic screening of inhibitor compounds that are discovered to have PDE inhibitory activity.This objective consists of two main activities:1A.Clone and express the catalytic domains of selected PDEs from M. hapla, C. elegans, and H. sapiens.1B. Determine the kinetic and pharmacological properties of nematode PDEs.Objective 2: Identification of novel compounds that bind to and inhibit the catalytic activity of nematode (M. hapla or C.elegans) PDEs.Our working hypothesis is that differences in the amino acid residues constituting the inhibitor binding pocket of nematode and vertebrate PDEs will result in differences in binding affinity that can be exploited to identify nematode-selective PDE inhibitor compounds.We will use a fragment-based, molecular docking approach to virtually screen a library of small molecular weight compounds as potential inhibitors of nematode PDEs and then conduct pharmacological assays for candidate PDE inhibitor molecules. This fragment-based drug discovery approachhasbeen successfully applied to the discovery of novel PDE inhibitors targeting distantly related PDEs (e.g.,trypanosomes) and thus is likely to identify potential nematicidal compounds targeting nematode PDEs.This objective consists of three main activities:2A.Homology modeling of nematode PDE catalytic domains based on human PDE templates.2B.

We will use two different experimental systems to address this poorly understood area of plant biochemistry and physiology: domesticated tomato fruit (Solanum lycopersicum), which show a large induction of wax biosynthesis during development and in response to drought stress; and fruits of S. neorickii and S. pennellii, which are indigenous to distinctly different habitats and/or have wax profiles that differ considerably from S. lycopersicum. We will exploit these genotypes to determine the dynamics of wax formation and cuticle properties under conditions of differing water stress and during postharvest storage. In addition, we will identify the biosynthetic and regulatory gene networks that govern these wax and desiccation resistant phenotypes and will map candidate genes in the wild tomato relatives. The functions of these genes will then be confirmed in transgenic tomato fruit. The outcomes of the proposal will represent a major advance in the understanding of wax biosynthetic and regulatory pathways, their contribution to cuticle properties and tomato fruit biology and postharvest traits, and will suggest strategies for enhancing shelf life and fruit quality.","A long-standing challenge in postharvest biology has been to understand the key factors that influence water loss and to develop strategies to reduce desiccation and consequent crop spoilage: a problem of enormous economic importance. While it is evident that the cuticle provides the primary barrier to water loss, remarkably little is known about the specific constituents that determine cuticle permeability, or how their synthesis is regulated. Using tomato fruit as a model, we will test the hypothesis that specific cuticular wax compounds play a crucial role in limiting desiccation. We will use a broad range of analytical approaches to develop a detailed understanding of wax diversity, compositional dynamics and functional significance during development and in response to drought stress in domesticated tomato and two wild relatives.","cuticle, desiccation, drought, fruit, solanum, tomato, water loss, wax"

PROJECT,SAES - KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,1008788,2016-67013-24731,Molecular mechanisms of transmission inhibition by a viral glycoprotein,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Whitfield, AN, E.",ACTIVE,"Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is considered one of the ten most devastating plant viruses due to the ubiquitous nature of the thrips (insect) vector and the extremely wide host range of the virus. TSWV is distributed worldwide, damaging over 1,000 plant species including important commodities such as tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, peanuts, potatoes and many ornamental plants. TSWV and related tospoviruses are considered emerging diseases because in recent years new species have been described, while the plant host range and geographical limits have expanded for established species. The western flower thrips (WFT) is the most efficient TSWV vector and it is an economically important pest in greenhouses and field crops. The management of thrips pests is difficult because populations of WFT have developed high levels of resistance to many insecticides. Transgenic plants are recognized as promising options for tospovirus management. We propose to exploit and elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) and dynamics of transgenic expression of a TSWV glycoprotein for control of tospovirus spread by WFT. TSWV depends exclusively on its thrips vector for plant-to-plant movement; therefore we propose to disrupt the disease cycle by interfering with the early events of virus transmission by the vector. Disruption of virus entry into the vector will prevent insect transmission or greatly reduce transmission efficiency and thus, stop the transmission cycle. TSWV entry into the thrips vector is mediated by the molecular interaction between the virus protein GN, which serves as a viral attachment protein, and the thrips midgut. Based on our recent finding that TSWV-infected tomato transgenics that express GN inhibited TSWV acquisition and transmission by WFT, we aim to determine the mechanism(s) of reduced acquisition from these transgenic plants, determine the efficacy of these transgenics to prevent spread of other related tospoviruses, and define the region of the GN protein that binds to thrips midguts. The outcome of this proposed work will bring us one step closer to our long-term goal of developing novel, sustainable, and biologically-based strategies for controlling TSWV in agricultural croplands and greenhouses.","Defining the molecular determinants of a plant virus-vector interaction enables the development of novel virus control strategies that aim to specifically disrupt the interaction. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and related tospoviruses are a threat to U.S. agriculture and food security. TSWV acquisition is mediated by the molecular interaction between the virus membrane glycoprotein GN, which serves as a viral attachment protein, and the thrips midgut. Previously, we found that an exogenously-applied soluble form of GN (GN-S) inhibits TSWV binding, acquisition, and transmission to a plant host. We generated transgenic tomato plants expressing a soluble form of GN with a GFP tag (GN-S::GFP) and found that thrips that fed on these transgenics had significantly lower virus titers and adult transmission efficiencies than thrips fed on TSWV-infected non-transgenic tomato plants. These results demonstrate that an initial reduction in virus infection of the larval insect midgut can result in a significant decrease in virus titer and transmission over the life-span of the vector.The long range goal of our proposed research is to further develop and improve the GN-S transgene approach through integration with other genes or transgenes that confer resistance to TSWV and related tospoviruses to enhance the durability of virus resistance. The aim of this proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the GNS-transgene mediated inhibition of tospovirus transmission and new knowledge of the vector molecular determinants that underpin the GN-S/thrips interaction. The specific research objectives are to:1) Determine the mechanism of transgenically-expressed GN-S::GFP inhibition of TSWV acquisition and transmission by WFT. We will use a combination of virological, biochemical, microscopy, and vector transmission techniques to test three alternative hypotheses;2) Test GN-S::GFP transgenic tomato plants for the ability to inhibit transmission of related and newly emerging tospoviruses. We will determine if the GN-S::GFP transgenic plants reduce transmission of field isolates of TSWV and related tospovirus species (TCSV and the newly described GRSV/TCSV natural M RNA reassortant virus); and3) Define the domains of GN required for binding to thrips midguts. We will identify the specific region(s) of GN that binds to thrips midguts to mediate viral attachment and entry into midgut cells. We will express different domains of the GN protein and measure binding to thrips guts, and ability to inhibit virus acquisition and transmission.","bunyaviridae, plant virology, thrips, tomato spotted wilt virus, tospovirus, vector biology"

The constraints imposed by crops&#39; intolerance to low temperature and the natural variations of the climate cause significant economic impacts to farmers, either directly through loss of crops or indirectly through reduced potential yield. While many aspects of plant biochemistry affect the overall tolerance of plants towards cold, a single modification of membrane lipids in the otherwise cold-hardy plant Arabidopsis thaliana is sufficient to make that plant extremely sensitive to even a mild cooling. This modification, a desaturation of the very long-chain fatty acids in sphingolipids, is relatively uncommon in nature, being found only in a few cold-tolerant plant species. Along with other evidence pointing towards a critical role for sphingolipid desaturation in determining plant cold-tolerance, it is hypothesized that sphingolipid desaturation is an adaptation that imparts cold-tolerance and that it can be used to improve the cold tolerance of cold-sensitive crops. This hypothesis will be tested by disrupting sphingolipid desaturation in the cold tolerant crops barley and Cammelina and introducing sphingolipid desaturation into the cold-sensitive crops sorghum and maize. The expected outcome of these experiments is a new means by which it will be possible to modify cold-tolerance in plants that could be broadly applicable to engineering cold-tolerance into a wide variety of important crop species","The goals for this project are: 1) Define the contribution of sphingolipids containing unsaturated VLCFA to chilling &amp; freezing resistance in crop species, 2) Determine the contribution of LCB desaturation to chilling &amp; freezing resistance in crop species, and 3) Modify sphingolipid desaturation in maize and sorghum to improve their cold-tolerant characteristics. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate that sphingolipid desaturation is a general adaptation to growth at low temperature and use sphingolipid desaturation to transfer cold-tolerant traits into impotant crop species.The objectives associated with each goal as as follows:1.1 Modify unsaturated VLCFA synthesis in Cammelina sativa by RNAi of ADS2.1.2 Disrupt unsaturated VLCFA synthesis in barley by disruption of the 24:1 specific KCS1.3 Measure the changes in lipid metabolism of the Cammelina and barley plants by lipid analysis of transgenic plants1.4 Test transgenic plants for sensitivity to cold and freezing1.5 Measure the level of plant hormones and lipids in cold-treated plants2.1 Express barley delta-8-desaturase in Arabidopsis sld1 genotype2.2 Test Arabidopsis plants for modified freezing tolerance2.3 Suppress expression of barley delta-8-desaturase by RNAi2.4 Assess the cold-tolerance of barley transgenic plants for sensitivity to cold and freezing2.5 Measure the level of plant hormones and lipids in cold-treated plants3.1 Perform field trials with transgenic sorghum containing sphingolipids with unsaturated VLCFA3.2 Create transgenic maize expressing VLCFA desaturase or the barley 24:1 specific KCS3.3 Perform cold-tolerance test and lipid analyses of the transgenic maize","sphingolipids, VLCFA, cold-tolerance, desaturation"

These high rates of losses are a concern for both beekeepers and the farmers who rely on a healthy honey bee population to pollinate their crops. In the US over $16 billion of produce rely on managed honey bees for pollination. This project aims to reduce the high rate of losses experienced by beekeepers by testing and promoting the adotion of data derived best management practices.There is growing consensus that multiple factors are contributing to poor bee health. Some of these are are in the direct control of beekeepers while others are not. This project focuses on practices in control of beekeepers . Over the last 5 years the Bee Informed Partnership has conducted surveys of beekeepers&#39; management practices and operational losses. We can now identify practices that seem to work beter than others. We plan to field validate these practices and, through various efforts, encourage best management practice adopion by beekeepers. We will do this by showing the economic advantages of Best Management Practices (BMP) adoption, encourage beekeepers to regularly have colonies tested for parastie and disease loads so they are more aware of the threats to their operations, and we will attempt to better understand why some beekeepers are willing to adopt new practices while others are not. We will also attempt to quantify factors, like the presence or absence of bee viruses, that may complicate BMP success.We believe that beekeepers who monitor disease levels in their operations are more likely to adopt best practicies, and by adopting such practices will reduce their losses. By continuing to build a community of beekeepers who consistently monitored and implement data informed best practices to manage their honey bee colonies, loss rates should decrease, with positive results for beekeepers, the farmers who rely on bees to pollinate their crops, and the citizens who have come to expect a safe and domestically produced food supply.","The overall goal of this proposed effort is to improve managed honey bee colony health by developing regionally, economically, culturally and operationally appropriate Best Management Practices. Building on our previous work, we will field validate, refine and encourage the implementation of dynamic Best Management Practices that address major threats to honey bee health and are informed by our real-time risk factor monitoring.Our specific objectives are as follows:Research:Field-validate the economic and colony health effects of adopting regional, operational, and cultural BMPs derived from an analysis of 5 years of management surveys.Quantify the potential effects that different, often interacting, risk factors have on BMP success through epidemiological meta-analysis of existing honey bee health datasets.Determine barriers to and facilitators of BMP diffusion and adoption using beekeeper and other social networks.Extension:Increase the number of beekeepers using data to inform and implement regional, economical, and operational specific BMPs.Refine and promote interactive real-time communication tools to disseminate BMP-actionable data to all beekeepers using web-based platforms.Education:Increase science literacy among beekeepers and help train the next generation of agricultural scientists.",honey bee best management practices colony health tech transfer team disease risk factors

This project will address these priorities by conducting research and delivering extension programming to evaluate implementation of reproductive technologies on small and medium-sized operations to analyze the farm level economics of changing production practices. Calves will be evaluated for post-weaning performance and end-product quality. The research will be conducted on ten small or medium-sized beef operations over two calf cycles (breeding to harvest). Cows will be divided into two treatment groups at each location. Treatments will be: 1) Estrous Synchronization - cows will be either synchronized or non-synchronized with both groups bred by natural service; 2) AI versus Natural Service - cows will be synchronized with half bred by AI, half natural service; or 3) Sexed Semen - cows will be synchronized and bred AI using either sexed semen to increase the proportion of male calves or non-sexed semen. A subset of calves will be retained following weaning with feedlot performance and carcass data collected through the Calf Value Discovery (CVD) program. Economic costs and benefits for each reproductive technology will be evaluated. Educational programming will include IRM learning communities, AI schools, CVD program, on-farm demonstrations, and the development of profit metrics.

PROJECT,SAES - NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008822,2016-68004-24847,Dissection and Deployment of Sustainable Disease and Pest Resistance in Wheat,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,50000.0,"Harris, MA.",ACTIVE,"Wheat, being essential for feeding the world&#39;s populations, is a key global resource for food security. A reading of world history provides countless examples of social, economic, and political chaos ensuing after just one or two years of poor grain harvests. Based on predictions of global populations in 2050, the FAO has stated that agricultural production needs to expand by 60%, at a minimum, to meet food needs and provide food security. Given the key position of wheat for food security, now is the time to formulate research plans for the coming decades.Biotic stress creates significant challenges for wheat production. In large part, biotic stress begins with attack by diseases and pests. The disciplines that study plant biotic stress, i.e., plant pathology, and entomology, developed independently over the past 100 years and until recently have emphasized different research questions. Genetics, genomics, molecular interactions, and direct plant resistance have been foci for plant pathology, while chemical ecology, signaling pathways, and indirect plant resistance have been foci for entomology (Harris et al. 2015). Direct plant resistance is conferred by plant traits that directly harm the plant&#39;s enemy. Indirect plant resistance is conferred by traits that attract natural enemies of the plant&#39;s enemy, with the natural enemy indirectly protecting the plant by directly harming the plant&#39;s enemy. Rarely have researchers explored what happens when a disease and a pest simultaneously attack wheat or any other plant.Genomics and molecular biology are changing this. Recent discoveries of shared strategies of diseases and pests for attacking plants, as well as shared strategies for plant defense, have raised questions about: 1) how plants integrate and prioritize defense responses against various forms of biotic stress, and 2) how defense responses influence other plant functions, including the survival, growth, and reproduction that are essential for wheat production. Alongside these questions are new opportunities for defending plants made possible by stunning advances in genomics and molecular biology.Today&#39;s plant breedersneed to stay apprised of thesechanges in science and technology. They also need to identify research priorities inasmuch new scientific discoveries and new technologies create new questions about the best way to proceed in plant breeding programs. Understanding plants as integrated systems, conserving and characterizing genetic resources, and training the next generation of plant breeders are essential if plant breeders are to continue translating scientific and technological advances into the cultivars that are the keystone of agricultural production and global food security.The critical role of plant breeding for Food Security is addressed in the recently released USDA Roadmap for Plant Breeding (March 2015). Two important points made in the Roadmap were: 1) one of three expected outcomes of the USDA&#39;s effort in plant breeding is to provide ""An enabling context for both public and private plant breeding, including better insights regarding priorities for each sector"" and 2) short-term competitive grants may not be the best way to promote the ""tangible work the breeder is educated and hired to do."" Achieving an integrated understanding of how a crop plant like wheat actually functions in the real world can also be hindered by a lack of communication between the different disciplines in agriculture, e.g. plant pathology, entomology, weed science, agronomy, plant physiology, genomics, etc.Wheat breeders have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders. To a large degree, they are the ones who translate scientific and technological advances into the cultivars that are the keystone of agricultural production and global food security. Yet other scientists who study wheat and its biotic interactions also have responsibilities, one of which is to support the efforts of wheat breeders. Something that would be useful for all wheat scientists is a cohesive picture of 1) the challenges to wheat production caused by biotic stress and 2) the degree to which wheat can be defended against biotic stress by breeding resistant cultivars.This Conference Proposal will help tofunda 2016 interdisciplinary conference ""Dissection and Deployment of Durable Resistance to Diseases and Pests of Wheat"".

As well as creating a cohesive picture of the challenges that biotic stress create for wheat production, we expect that conversations among members of the Wheat Biotic Stress Community will help to anticipate questions that arise as advances in science and technology provide new opportunities for breeding wheat cultivars. Anticipating such questions will help set research priorities for research questions that may take years to answer. Examples of such questions are: 1) Is genetic resistance to all diseases and pests present in wheat&#39;s gene pool or will some diseases and pests have to be controlled in other ways? 2) Do some wheat resistance traits create challenges that are beyond the evolutionary potential of enemies to adapt? Thus, can we make wheat resistance more durable or even permanent? If yes, how do we predict which plant traits will confer durable resistance? 3) Will more broad-spectrum resistance traits be found and how do these traits differ from traits mediated by species- and race-specific Resistance genes? 4) Do defense responses have costs for other plant functions, such as survival, growth, and reproduction?","Wheat isessential for Global Food Security.

Soil contamination with these human pathogens represents a major problem for the fresh produce supply chain because of the lack of valid remediation strategies that growers could implement to reduce and/or eliminate the presence of naturally occurring human pathogens. Soil contamination with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes across major production regions within the U.S has resulted in numerous acres of abandoned crops including leafy greens and melons. Destruction of multiple fields or contaminated crops due to human pathogen contamination has initiated a decline in the economy of many states not only due to the loss of high cash crops but also to increased environmental damage owed mainly to the use of non-sustainable practices.Our research will focus on three main objectives: 1- studying the prevalence of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on farm land used for leafy green and melon production that utilize uncomposted manure following the 90 to 120day rule for organic productions. 2- We will use this information to develop challenge studies where the persistence of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes will be assessed after the application of three intervention strategies: - cover cropping, 2- solarization and 3- the incorporation of grape pomace and mushroom compost to soil mesocosms.

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT,1007724,2016-67017-24427,Bioaccumulation and Depuration of Nanoparticles by Marine Bivalves: Potential Foodborne Hazards and Implications for Shellfish Safety,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,474959.0,"Ward, J, EV.",ACTIVE," Manufactured nanomaterials are being used in a variety of consumer products including sunscreens, cosmetics, personal-care products, and paints. Nanomaterials are extremely small compounds having at least one dimension less than 100 nanometers. For comparison, one typical hair from a human head or a single sheet of paper has a thickness of approximately 100,000 nanometers. These tiny particles are smaller than the cells of a human body and, in fact, smaller than the nucleus inside of those cells. With an increasing presence in household goods, the demand for and the production of nanomaterials composed of carbon, metal oxides, polystyrene and silica has also increased. For example, to fill product needs the world-wide production of titanium-dioxide nanoparticles is projected to exceed 200,000 tons/year by 2016. As the production of nanomaterials increases, so too does the likelihood of release into the environment as a result of spills, use of products, post-consumer degradation of material, leaching from septic tanks and landfills, or outflow from wastewater treatment facilities. Many questions regarding the environmental safety of nanomaterials have been raised. Toxicological effects of nanoparticles in humans are well studied and include inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage. Even particles made of low-toxicity material (e.g., polystyrene) can be harmful when delivered in their nano form, presumably due to their high surface area. Comparatively little research has focused on the effects of nanomaterials on marine ecosystems, or whether this class of emerging pollutants could be transferred through marine food webs to humans. Coastal ecosystems near densely populated, industrialized regions are particularly vulnerable to the infiltration of man-made materials such as nanoparticles. Filter-feeding bivalves, such as clams, mussels and oysters, which are harvested or cultured for human consumption, are particularly susceptible to nanoparticle exposure given their abundance in coastal waters and their particle feeding behavior. Few studies, however, have addressed how these animals encounter nanoparticles in the environment and little is known about the accumulation and elimination of nanoparticles by bivalves. In this project, we will investigate whether nanoparticles could be a foodborne hazard in shellfish. Specifically, we will study: 1) the way in which bivalves encounter and ingest nanoparticles; 2) whether they accumulate nanoparticles during chronic exposure; and 3) if bivalves can eliminate the nanoparticles from their body after exposure ceases, and if so how long does it take. Results will provide realistic estimates of exposure and bioaccumulation of nanoparticles in shellfish, and help elucidate the potential for nanoparticles to be passed to higher trophic levels including humans. Ultimately, new knowledge generated by our research will inform decision makers, and guide strategies for the management of this class of emerging pollutants, and help ensure and improve shellfish safety. Through outreach and dissemination activities, we will educate and deliver science-based knowledge to scientists, shellfish growers, managers, and the general public in order to inform decision making. Such actions will serve to enhance the environmental quality of coastal ecosystems and help protect the living marine resources on which aquaculture and fisheries rely. Protecting fish and shellfish resources is important for both long-range improvement and sustainability of the aquaculture and fisheries industries. Determining the extent to which nanoparticles are an emerging food safety issue is also critical for ensuring the quality and safety of seafood collected by recreational activities. Such activities have been shown to enhance human health and the well-being of society."," The proposed research will examine an emerging food safety issue by characterizing the uptake and depuration of an emerging pollutant (i.e., manufactured nanoparticles) by several species of commercially important marine bivalves, including: 1) the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis; 2) the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica; and 3) the quahog clam, Mercenaria mercenaria. These benthic suspension feeders are among the most important bivalve species on the East and Gulf Coasts of the US, supporting large aquaculture and fisheries industries (USDA 2005). The study will determine the bioaccumulation and depuration of two different types of nanoparticles that are commonly used for industrial applications and in a variety of consumer products, including: titanium dioxide (TiO2) and plastic (polystyrene). Specifically, we will investigate how feeding limitations and the form of delivery (freely suspended or incorporated in marine aggregations) affects nanoparticle bioavailability, ingestion, and thus internal exposure. Informed by these results, we will then expose bivalves to nanoparticles for several weeks and determine net bioaccumulation, and after exposure ceases, quantify the rate of elimination during depuration. To accomplish these goals, we have developed several lines of research to investigate nanoparticles as an emerging food safety issue:&bull; Initiative 1: Determine bioavailability by quantifying the rates at which freely suspended nanoparticles and nanoparticles incorporated within marine aggregates are ingested;&bull; Initiative 2: Quantify the bioaccumulation of nanoparticles during a chronic exposure of several weeks;&bull; Initiative 3: Define the depuration rate and residual concentrations (if any) of nanoparticles over a post-exposure period, and estimate the overall bioaccumulation factors.","bivalves, emerging contaminants, emerging foodborne hazard, food safety, nanoparticles, shellfish"

With an eye toward mechanization, growers are increasingly adopting high-density orchards that feature narrow almost two-dimensional canopies that create ""fruiting walls"", which are easier to harvest. Harvest-aid platforms are also being developed and offered by several companies as an intermediate step towards full mechanization. These machines aim at increased harvest efficiency by eliminating ladders. However, adoption by US growers is still limited, even in modern high-density orchards. The main reasons are high cost and often inadequate efficiency and labor savings. The major factor that limits harvesting throughput is the mismatch between the non-uniform fruit distribution and the pickers&#39; uneven and varying picking speeds. This project aspires to develop affordable technologies for next-generation, robotic harvest-aid orchard platforms. The machines we envision will function as co-bots that collaborate with fruit pickers by physically carrying them and intelligently adjusting their vertical positioning with respect to the canopies in the orchard. The proposed machines will use advanced sensing to estimate incoming fruit yield and worker picking speeds. Based on these data they will modulate the incoming fruit flow by optimally adjusting their own travel speed, and dynamically elevate each picker to a &#39;fruit zone&#39; that matches her/his speed and maximizes the overall platform throughput. Improved picker safety and ergonomics will also be incorporated in robotic platform design and operation.Intellectual merit. The project investigates a novel human-robot physical interaction mode, in which a team of humans harvests fruit while standing on a robotic orchard platform, which controls each worker&#39;s vertical positioning to optimize collective performance. A rigorous approach to automated harvest-aid platform operation analysis and control is proposed. The platform, workers and fruiting-wall system is regarded as a processing line in a flexible manufacturing system. The optimizing principle of matching incoming flow with machine capacity is applied to robotic platforms leading to the original concept of controlling platform speed and picker placement to match picker speeds with appropriate harvesting zones of the fruiting wall. The theoretical activities will be complemented with advancement of the state-of-the-art in imaging and sensing technologies to estimate fruit densities and picker harvest rates. If robotic picking is to become practical multi-arm robotic harvesters will face the same efficiency, sensing and control issues. Therefore, by addressing robotic platform operation researchers are ""paving the way"" to fully mechanized selective harvesting.Broader impact. By accelerating the adoption of robotic harvest-aid platforms the project will bring financial benefits for U.S. fruit growers; market advantages for SMEs building agricultural equipment; increased safety and higher wages for farm workers; work opportunities for a wider, less physically capable labor pool, including women who are the backbone of rural communities; and fresh affordable fruits for consumers. The project&#39;s educational agenda spans the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 levels and utilizes project-based learning and fieldwork to cross-pollinate among disciplines. The researchers will leverage the themes of the project and the increasing awareness and concern for sustainable and healthy food production to engage K-12 students in STEM-promoting activities.","Our long-term goal is to develop the theoretical and technological tools that will enable the design, optimization, prototyping and field-testing of consistently high-throughput, cost-effective mechanized harvesting systems for modern orchards. As part of this effort, this proposal aspires to robotize harvest-aid orchard platforms. The machines we envision will function as co-bots that collaborate with fruit pickers by physically carrying them and intelligently adjusting their vertical positioning with respect to the canopies in the orchard. The proposed machines will use advanced sensing to estimate incoming fruit yield and worker picking speeds, in order to optimally regulate platform travel speed and picking stations&#39; elevations. Essentially, these robotic platforms will (a) modulate the incoming fruit flow by optimally adjusting their own travel speed; and (b) dynamically assign each picker to a &#39;fruit zone&#39; that matches their speed and maximizes the overall platform throughput.The proposed project must address three major research challenges: 1) model the machine-aided harvesting process that results from the complex interactions of orchard, pickers and robotic platform, in order to facilitate design, optimization and controller development for the automated harvesting system; 2) develop a robust, accurate and relatively inexpensive sensing system for fruit yield density and worker picking rates; 3) develop human-in-the-loop control system for platform operation, which increases efficiency while ensuring picker safety. The project will also evaluate the performance of the prototype system during commercial fruit harvesting in real-world conditions.Research Goal 1: Modeling of fruit harvesting with a robotic orchard platformThis objective aims at developing a harvesting simulation tool that will be used to explore, gain intuition, develop and fine-tune control schemes for platform speed and worker positioning. The performance measure will be the platform&#39;s harvesting speed, i.e., the collective picking rate of all workers on the platform. Picking speed depends on orchard layout and tree architecture, fruit distribution, worker positioning on the platform, individual worker picking speed and pattern, and platform speed. Simulating these coupled interacting systems (orchard, pickers, platform, controller) is a major challenge. The following sections formulate the objectives and tasks that must be accomplished toward this research goal.Objective 1.1: Create instances of virtual orchards.This objective aims at creating 3D models of fruit trees in rows of SNAP architecture commercial orchards, and at digitizing the positions of the fruits in the canopies. These digitized trees will serve as input to the robotic platform harvest-aid simulator; fruit positions will provide fruit density as a function of height for any position and height in a digitized orchard row.Objective 1.2: Develop human picking models.Just like digital models of actual trees will be used as input to the platform-based harvesting simulator, human picking models are needed to provide realistic individual picking rates. Our approach will be to model the process of manual fruit picking and estimate the stochastic parameters of the process from captured picker motion data. This approach is inspired by literature in production systems modeling, and it has been recently applied in the agricultural (greenhouse) sector.Objective 1.3: Develop platform-based fruit picking simulator.The Gazebo open source robotics simulator will be used to model platform-based harvesting by coupling the tree, picker and platform models. This simulator features a robust physics engine to calculate machine kinematics and dynamics, and a computational geometry engine to detect obstacle collisions.Research Goal 2: Develop a sensing system for platform-based fruit picking.The platform&#39;s control system has four sensory inputs: the fruit-density, the picker rates, the height of the picker platforms, and the velocity of the harvest platform. The latter two will be implemented using off-the-self sensors. Estimating fruit density and picking rates poses technical challenges that are discussed next.Objective 2.1: Estimate fruit yield density.It is essential that the yield density be estimated in real time, so that worker positioning and platform speed can be controlled in an optimal manner. We will leverage and build upon recent work from parter CMU on image-based fruit yield mapping in orchards and vineyards for detecting green-fruit over green-leaf background.Objective 2.2: Real time estimation of each worker&#39;s fruit picking rate.Efforts to produce harvested yield data for manually picked fruits do not work in real time (i.e., they report yield after harvest) and work either at the bin-level, or use expensive technology that requires changes in workers&#39; harvesting activities. We propose to design and build a novel, low-cost, instrumented picking bag/basket that will measure harvested fruit weight in real time using load cells, and will transmit the data wirelessly to the platform&#39;s control system.Objective 2.3: Online calibration of imaging system with picking rate estimatesWe need a framework to reconcile and fuse the multiple sensing modalities to update the sensing parameters and picker performance models during operation to provide high-fidelity input into our control system. To reconcile fruit-density (fruit per area of fruiting wall) from the imaging system with picker rates we can use the vehicle velocity to convert the picker rates integrated over all pickers into a harvested fruit-density measurement.Research Goal 3: Develop human-in-the-loop platform control system.Objective 3.1: Develop control algorithm for platform operation.The platform&#39;s controller must increase picking efficiency and ensure picker safety. The controller inputs are: incoming fruit densities on both picking sides; platform speed; and the picker harvest speeds and elevations. The binary &#39;picking/not picking&#39; signal is also available. A model predictive controller that optimizes throughput over a finite time horizon will be developed and tested.Objective 3.2: Integrate real-time sensing and control.For this project objective, we will design an application-programing interface (API) where software running on the control system can access the sensing data and interact with the actuators (velocity of the vehicle and heights of the pickers). The API design will enable the control interface to request the current fruit density estimate at the given location and height as measured from the image data.Research Goal 4: System prototyping and field evaluation.Objective 4.1: Robotize harvest-aid platform.A self-propelled harvest-aid platform is available at UC Davis. The platform will undergo significant physical modifications to support independently actuated worker positions and scissor lift tables will be installed on appropriately prepared sides of the platform chassis. Special attention will be paid to platform safety.Objective 4.2: Evaluate robotic platform in orchards.A direct comparison of robotic and conventional platform operating modes will be conducted in high-density orchards in California, for different crops and architectures (e.g., v-trellis apple trees, Kearny-v peach trees). The response variables of interest will be harvesting throughput (average minutes to fill one bin and total number of filled bins per person per hour) and ergonomics.","modeling, robotics, simulation, virtual."
PROJECT,SAES - PURDUE UNIVERSITY,1007743,2016-67017-24592,Improving Thiamin (Vitamin B1) Delivery in Foods by Understanding its Physical and Chemical Stability in Natural Form and Enriched Products,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,427025.0,"Mauer, LI.",ACTIVE,"Thiamin deficiencies impact populations in both developed and developing countries. In many cases, fortifying staple refined foods with thiamin can mitigate the deficiencies. To optimize the delivery of thiamin, it must be stable in the product throughout storage and use. Current US consumer demands (and therefore industry trends) include increasing both whole-grain (whole-food) and gluten-free products. More information is needed to document the impact of thiamin ingredient form, food matrix, and processing and storage conditions on the stability of thiamin throughout shelf-life in a variety of food products beyond refined and enriched wheat-based foods. The proposed study will document the magnitude of thiamin losses through production and storage scenarios, encompassing a variety of thiamin ingredient forms, model systems, staple refined foods (based on wheat, corn, and rice), and food products (including gluten-free). Not only will this information be useful to compare thiamin stability in whole and fortified foods made from staple crops throughout the world, but it will also be useful to support thiamin-containing gluten-free product development efforts. The ultimate goal is to improve the delivery of thiamin in a variety of foods to promote a safe (interpret this as gluten-free for Celiac patients), sufficient, and nutritious food supply for both developed and developing nations. This project will address the USDA program area priority in Program Area A1361 ""Improving Food Quality"" by comprehensively investigating thiamin stability in natural and synthetic ingredients and whole and fortified foods and then developing recommendations to stabilize and optimize the delivery of thiamin in both ingredients and foods. While research on thiamin stability is available in the literature, we believe that ours is a novel approach, combining an applied characterization of thiamin content and stability in foods and ingredients, including investigations of gluten-free products, with a fundamental extension of the latest in scientific advances on solid state architecture from the pharmaceutical arena to whole food applications. In particular, our proposed research has the following novel features: 1) A systematic investigation of natural and synthetic as well as crystalline and amorphous thiamin structures; 2) Development of a mechanistic understanding of how common food ingredients (starch, proteins, and gums) disrupt the molecular assembly of thiamin additives, resulting in amorphous structures with altered physical and chemical stability; 3) A direct comparison of the stability of natural and synthetic thiamin forms in food and model systems across relevant production and storage scenarios; and 4) An understanding of the synergistic or antagonistic formulation/process/environmental interactions on the kinetics of thiamin degradation through processing and storage of foods. The Specific Objectives are designed to enhance the fundamental understanding of the impacts of vitamin form, formulation, solid state properties, and storage treatment interactions on thiamin stability and to develop recommendations for improving the stability of thiamin in foods. The Potential Impact and Expected Outcomes of the fundamental new knowledge we will generate in manipulating thiamin ingredients in crystalline forms and amorphous dispersions include the development of recommendations and implementation of solid state strategies to enhance thiamin additive stability in both ingredients and foods. Scientifically sound recommendations developed from this work will enable selection of the optimal form of thiamin for different products, with the potential to improve delivery of thiamin in a wide variety of products and ultimately reduce rates of thiamin deficiencies in both developed and developing countries.","The long-term goal of this interdisciplinary effort is to improve the delivery of thiamin in whole foods and food ingredients. The objectives of this project are designed to enhance the fundamental understanding of the impacts of vitamin form, formulation, solid state properties, and storage treatment interactions on thiamin stability. Thiamin degradation will be modeled, and the optimal form of thiamin for different products will be identified based on the interplay between physical and chemical stability across formulation, production, and storage scenarios. The central hypothesis is that different thiamin forms will exhibit different stability traits, including response to food formulation and production scenarios, and therefore recommendations can be developed for selecting the optimum thiamin form for a particular product or process. The supporting objectives are to:Monitor the stability of thiamin (natural and synthetic forms, including different crystalline forms) through the production and storage of whole and refined grain flours and products (wheat, rice, corn) and model food systems, and identify formulation, matrix (crystalline and amorphous systems), processing, and storage factors (e.g., temperature and relative humidity, RH) that have a significant impact on thiamin degradation kinetics.Develop mathematical models and elucidate reaction constants that can be used to predict thiamin degradation in food ingredients and products based on the type of ingredient/food, process, storage conditions, and other significant factors identified in Objective 1, and document interactions between thiamin and food ingredients, as a basis for recommendations for the optimal form of thiamin for different ingredients, foods, and use scenarios.","Amorphous dispersions, crystallization, food quality, gluten-free, shelf-life, vitamin stability"

Although high tunnel production has several advantages with regard to crop growth, it can modify the light characteristics in a way that can adversely affect the crop nutritive and health-promoting characteristics. Typical poly covers used in high tunnel and low tunnel production can alter light characteristics to reduce the production of many bioactive and health-promoting phytochemicals. Therefore, one of the primary goals of this project is to gain an understanding of the role of light factors (intensity and spectral characteristics) on nutritive and health-promoting qualities of lettuce and tomato in high tunnel production, and develop light management tools for both pre- and post harvest stages to improve/maintain high nutritive qualities in these crops. We will investigate the complex role of light factors on the production and accumulation of these phytochemicals in growth chamber and greenhouse studies. Following this, a three-year field trail will be conducted using high tunnels with photoselective covers to develop appropriate strategies to enhance the quality of these crops. Similarly, optimal light factors and practical methods will be identified by using the emerging LED (light emitting diode) technology during postharvest storage to maintain/improve the nutritional attributes of the harvested crops. From these studies, we will develop an integrated light management strategy to produce high quality nutritionally rich food for high tunnel production systems and postharvest handling of tomato and lettuce crops.",The primary goals of this project are:1. to gain an understanding of the specific impact of light intensity and its spectral qualities on the production and accumulation of nutritional and health-promoting compounds in tomato and lettuce2. to identify and develop effective field strategies to manipulate light characteristics in high tunnel production to enhance nutritional and health-promoting qualities3. to evaluate and develop postharvest light treatments to enhance the nutritional and health-promoting qualities and to improve the shelf-life of these crops by making use of LEDs with specific spectral characteristics.,"high tunnel, human health, led, light factors, nutritional quality, phytochemicals, vegetables"

Some of the health benefits associated with these dietary components are derived from pigments present in plants called flavonoids. However, our bodies do not absorb most flavonoids as they are present in the plants. Flavonoids are metabolined by the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut (i.e., gut microbiota). Gut microbes contribute to the beneficial effects of flavonoids by transforming them into more readily absorbable and active metabolites. However, there is a large degree of interpersonal variation in the observed benefits and, evidently, in the nature and extent of these microbial transformations, which remain poorly characterized. Thus, we cannot currently predict the extent to which--if at all--an individual will benefit from the consumption of flavonoids. This proposal describes an approach for determining the relationship between interpersonal differences in gut microbial transformations of flavonoids and the beneficial effects associated with their consumption. We will investigate how interpersonal variation in gut microbiota composition affects the protective effects of a specific group of flavonoids. We will transplant human gut microbial communities (i.e., human feces) from healthy subjects and subjects with cardiovascular disease into groups of otherwise identical germ-free mice (i.e., mice that are not colonized with any microbes), and test for causal associations between gut microbial community composition, flavonoid transformations and development of atherosclerosis. Collectively, these studies will provide key insights into the roles of gut microbes in mediating effects associated consumption of flavonoids. Importantly, these results will be used to identify new probiotics that may be given together with anthocyanins to enhance their effects against cardiovascular disease.","Consumption of diets rich in flavonoids reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Revolutions in the breeding of many major crops point to a recurring theme: selection of genetic variation in the universal florigen flowering pathway. A prominent example is the classical self pruning (sp) mutant of tomato, which provided a bushy ""determinate"" growth habit that enabled large-scale field production. We recently discovered that induced mutations in multiple components of the tomato florigen pathway can be exploited to customize and improve determinate growth and yield in a processing ""roma"" cultivar. In this pre-breeding project, we will apply our ""florigen pathway toolkit"" to improve fresh market tomato production. We will use genetic crossing to introduce recently discovered beneficial mutations in genes that promote and repress flowering signals into elite large- and small-fruited tomato inbreds and hybrids. By uniting expertise in tomato flowering and developmental genetics with tomato breeding, we will generate a range of combinations of florigen pathway mutations, and this set of genotypes will be evaluated for modified determinate growth that improve flower production and yield. Finally, we will combine classical forward genetics with genome engineering technology to identify new genes that can expand our toolkit to favorably modify plant architecture for breeding. Our goal is to release valuable germplasm that can immediately be introduced into U.S. breeding programs.","Tomato breeding goals are multifaceted and shift according to the needs and desires of growers (e.g. improved pest resistance) and consumers (e.g. better quality), but one unwavering goal is to improve yield. Our goal in this project is to use our toolkit of florigen pathway mutations to generate novel germplasm in a pre-breeding program that can customize and optimize shoot architecture and yield for fresh market tomatoes. We will focus on elite inbreds and leading commercial hybrids for large- and small-fruited tomatoes that are widely produced in the U.S. The large-fruited inbreds we will use are Fla. 8059 and Fla. 7907B, parents of the widely produced hybrid Fla. 8153. This commercial hybrid has broad environmental adaptability, evidenced by its current production in multiple states for year-round supply.

For the small-fruited inbred, we will use NC 3 Grape, which is a parent in the commercial hybrid &#39;Smarty&#39;. The UFL breeding program has already obtained NC 3 Grape from the North Carolina State breeding program through a material transfer agreement, which allows for crosses and evaluations as proposed for this project. Significantly, given the commercial relevance of the inbreds we have chosen, positive outcomes from our pre-breeding project can immediately benefit tomato production in the U.S. and beyond.In this project, we will translate our recent findings on the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying florigen-dependent flowering in tomato to develop novel germplasm in a pre-breeding program that has the potential to transform the fresh market tomato industry.

Early reports on the effects of climate change warned of widespread increases in the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks, but these warnings have proven to be overgeneralizations. More recent studies have detected a wide range of pest responses to climate change, from outbreaks of unprecedented severity, to a recent cessation of outbreaksthat had occurred in consistent cyclesfor over 1100 years. Pest species are also subject to human interventions intended to limit their negative impacts, but knowledge of how management interventions, such as pesticide application, influence pest populations over the long term is limited. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the effects of climate and management on the outbreaks of agricultural and forest insect pests. Doing so is vital to adapting forest management and agricultural practices to the effects of climate change, and to predicting whether insects that are currently not important pests could become significant pests in future climates.The methodological approach of this project has several components. First, a database will be compiled that describes how the abundance of &gt;40 insect pest species, in multiple locations representing seven regions of the US, has changed through time. These data will be collected from published studies, public repositories, and groups such as state agricultural extensions. Analysis of the database will occur in four main steps. First, historical pest population patterns will be characterized, focusing on two questions. Overall, is the population increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? And, does the pest experience recurring outbreaks, and if so are they changing in their frequency or severity? Second, climate and management drivers of pest population dynamics will be evaluated. To improve insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to changes in pest abundance, changes in abundance will be statistically decomposed into two factors that, respectively, represent the direct effects of environmental conditions, and effects that are mediated through interactions with other organisms, such as competition and predation. Then, relationships between each of these factors and variables representing climate and management effort will be quantified to investigate how climate and management affect the long-term population dynamics of insect pests. Third, the hypothesis that similar species respond similarly to climate change will be tested by statistically searching for characteristics of life history, ecology, and geography that are associated with a species&#39; response to climate change, for example whether its abundance is increasing or declining. If effective, this approach could be used to predict general responses of pest species for which little data is available, or to identify species that are not currently abundant but could emerge as significant pests in the future. The fourth and final step is to predict the potential future impact of these pests. Results from previous analytical steps will inform the development of models of how climate affects changes in pest abundance, which will be applied to projections from a suite of climate models to predict the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks between the present day and the year 2050.The ultimate goal of this project is to elucidate how climate variability, climate change, and management effort influence insect outbreaks. This question has significant socioeconomic implications given the negative impacts of insect pests on food production, forestry, outdoor recreation, and homeowner expenditures and property values. Improved understanding of underlying patterns and drivers of insect outbreaks, and their potential to change in future climates, is expected to inform adaptive strategies that limit these adverse impacts and improve the security and sustainability of agricultural and forest production.","The overarching goal of this project is to assess how climate variability and change influence the population dynamics of outbreaking agricultural and forest pests. Toward that end, four specific objectives are as follows:Characterize recent population dynamic patterns of insect pests.Quantify how climate and management effort (e.g., pesticide application) drive pest population dynamics.Evaluate whether life history and ecological characteristics can predict how a species&#39; populations will respond to climate change.Project effects of pests on crop and forest production out to the year 2050.","agriculture, climate change, forestry, insect pests, outbreak, population dynamics"

As a detriment, dairy producer profit margins are diminished and sustainability of the American dairy industry is challenged. Approaches to increase insulin sensitivity to reduce fat mobilization represent a new means to prevent metabolic disease in cows thus ensuring that our nation is best prepared for the growing food demand. Thus our goal is to define the mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in dairy cattle. Overweight cows during late pregnancy exhibit elevated blood insulin, glucose, and fatty acids (i.e. overnutrition syndrome), similar to humans with metabolic syndrome; therefore, our hypotheses reflect mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in humans and rodents. An initiating event is reduced fatty acid oxidation (i.e. breakdown) in liver cells. In turn, ceramide accumulates in liver tissue, which is subsequently packaged into lipoproteins that enter circulation. Ceramides are a type of fat molecule known to cause insulin resistance in rodent models. We hypothesize that liver-derived ceramides impair insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. Decreasing the synthesis and accumulation of ceramide in overweight dairy cattle may be a means to restore insulin sensitivity and health. In a joint effort between West Virginia University and Johns Hopkins University, we will test our hypotheses by employing mass spectrometry-based lipidomics to profile ceramides in lipoproteins, plasma, and liver and adipose tissues before and after calving in lean and overweight dairy cows. We will also determine whether inhibition of ceramide synthesis can prevent insulin resistance in overweight dairy cows. Furthermore, we will also characterize whether ceramide can be used as a biomarker tomonitor dairy cow health, fertility, and milk production potential. Collectively, we anticipate that ceramide is the intermediary link between overnutrition and the development of insulin resistance in dairy cows transitioning from gestation to lactation. We expect to identify a means to improve insulin sensitivity and provide a new diagnostic approach to monitor the progression of metabolic disease in dairy cows. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate insulin resistance in overweight cows will enable us to devise practical strategies to prevent metabolic disease to support increased milk production and fertility. ","Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that mediate the development of insulin resistance in overweight cows during the gestation to lactation transition. This long-term goal will be achieved with three objectives. For objective 1, we will utilize mass spectrometry to characterize the sphingolipid profile of liver-derivedlipoprotein subfractions collected from lean and overweight dairy cows before and after calving. Hepatic lipoprotein ceramide secretion will be compared with liver and plasma fatty acid and sphingolipid profiles to determine relationships between lipids with specific fatty acyl-chain lengths and saturation. We will also evaluate de novo ceramide synthesis and sphingomyelin hydrolysis to understand how ceramide generating pathways are regulated in liver and adipose tissues of peripartal dairy cows. Local and systemic measurements of insulin sensitivity will also be performed. For objective 2, we will determine whether ceramide mediates insulin resistance in overweight dairy cows. Using an in vivo approach, we will evaluate the effects of ceramide synthesis inhibition on insulin sensitivity in overweight cows. In vitro, we will explore whether nutrient excess mediates insulin resistance and lipolysis in bovine adipocytes by increasing intracellular ceramide synthesis, and whether extracellular lipoprotein ceramide can antagonize insulin action in adipocytes via a macrophage-dependent mechanism. For objective 3, we will assess the relationship between ceramide synthesis and health, fertility, and milk production outcomes.","adipose, ceramide metabolism, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, metabolic disease, transition cow"

Our goals are to address critical issues related to wheat quality through (1) elucidating the mechanism for the effect of PHS, (2) clarifying the relationship between FN and end-use quality, and (3) facilitating the development of new wheat varieties that are more resistant to PHS. The acquisition of a FN system in this proposal will enhance research capacity at the University of Idaho (UI), the teaching quality of the food science and plant science programs, and the collaboration between food science and wheat breeding program at the UI. Through performing experiments, graduate students who are involved in the proposed project will receive laboratory instruction, and gain skills in performing experiment, critical thinking and problem solving. Through teaching starch chemistry course, students will learn specific knowledge of starch chemistry and apply the knowledge to solve related problems in food and agricultural industries.

The resurgence in interests has stemmed largely from recent findings that sweet ""taste"" receptors are located throughout the body, include the GI tract where they are located on enteroendocrine cells. This has prompted rethinking about whether the various HIS, once considered inert, may actually exert important biological effects with a wide spectrum of health outcomes.The issue of high intensity sweeteners and health has been addressed in sessions at multiple scientific meetings. However, often only one side of the issue is presented. In other instances, opposing views are showcased. This is fine if the goal is to disseminate perspectives, but neither approach serves the purpose of critically reviewing the evidence and drawing reasoned, science-based conclusions. To achieve this end, it is necessary to move beyond presenters, to the science itself. This proposed conference is designed for that purpose.We propose to hold a highly structured international conference with invited presenters and discussants. The unique design of the program aims to highlight the state of the science stripped from hyperbole and innuendo. In addition to presentations related to the ecology of sweet taste, mechanisms of sweet taste and trends in high intensity sweetener use, the specific topics often linked to health concerns that will be considered are, HIS use and A) gut digestive, endocrine and absorptive function B) microbiota; C) brain reward pathways; and D) appetite, food intake and energy balance. Impressions of the science by all attending the meeting will be tracked with real-time computer polling. However, the greater impact of the meeting will likely be achieved through publication of the proceedings in a special issue of Physiology &amp; Behavior (option already confirmed).The goal of the conference is to highlight the science related to the heal effects of HIS so that policy makers, clinicians and consumers can make informed decisions about their use.",This funding is to support an international conference.

The main objective of this proposal is to investigate basic mechanisms governing the neonatal-microbial relationship that influence intestinal homeostasis and host health. This will be investigated using a well characterized, reproducible gnotobiotic mouse model colonized with a simplified microbial community. Using this model, we will investigate how colonization with E. coli differentially affects mucosal homeostasis by comparing the outcome of colonizating neonates versus weanlings.Additionally, the impact of a probiotic Lactobacillus will be evaluated as a preventative intervention. Gnotobiotic mice will be colonized with E. coli +/- Lactobacillus, and colitis induced using dextran sodium sulfate. Markers of mucosal homeostasis, immunologic parameters, and microbial changes will be evaluated. The central hypothesis is that colonization of a pathobiont will differentially affect mucosal homeostasis and gut health depending on the age at colonization by reshaping the microbial community and inducing proinflammatory immune responses.

The prevalence of ticks throughout the world makes them one of the most economically important ectoparasites of livestock. Current control methods include chemical acaricides; however, the emergence of resistant strains has reduced their efficacy. Efforts to maximize acaricide effectiveness are hindered by a paucity of information on the molecular and physiological mechanisms of acaricide resistance in ticks. Additionally, the efficacy of acaricides on ticks stressed by environmental conditions is an unexplored area. This study will identify underlying mechanisms of acaricide resistance in ticks by examining the physiological and molecular responses to pesticide exposure; additionally, the impact of environmental conditions on pesticide efficacy will be examined. The study systems will be the American dog and lone star ticks, species that parasitize many organisms, including livestock. Changes in gene expression in response to pesticide exposure and environmental stress will be examined using RNA-sequencing techniques. Additionally, fluctuations in metabolite levels will be measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Important genes and metabolites will be identified to elucidate mechanisms of acaricide resistance and to understand how changes in environmental conditions may influence acaricide efficacy. Results of this work have the potential to be integrated into existing tick control programs to maximize acaricide effectiveness and mitigate the development of acaricide resistance.

PROJECT,SAES - OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,1007952,2016-67012-24691,Characterization of the contribution of cell-cell signaling to efficient metabolic coupling between nitrifying microorganisms.,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,150000.0,"Mellbye, BR, LE.",ACTIVE,"Modern industrialized agriculture is sustained by heavy application of inorganic nitrogen (N)-based fertilizer. In this practice, up to 60% of N fertilizer can be lost through transformation to other nitrogen compounds and leaching into groundwater, and through greenhouse gas emissions. These effects can reduce crop yields, pollute groundwater, and increase global warming. For example, in 2011, the EPA estimated that fertilizer application accounted for 69% of total US nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions. The loss of N fertilizer, production of greenhouse gas, and the efficiency of inorganic-nitrogen uptake by plants are all influenced by the process of nitrification. Nitrification is carried out primarily by two diverse groups of soil microorganisms: the ammonia oxidizers (bacteria and archaea) that transform ammonia to the more toxic nitrite, and the nitrite oxidizers (bacteria) that transform nitrite to plant-preferred nitrate. Inefficient coupling of nitrification can lead to toxic effects caused by accumulated nitrite, including nitrous oxide greenhouse gas production, while complete nitrification leads to leaching of accumulated nitrate into groundwater. The mechanism of establishing and maintaining coupling of nitrification in soils, especially between diverse soil microorganisms, is poorly understood. A possible mechanism to establish and maintain coupling among these microorganisms is cell-cell signaling, termed quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria.Acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) chemical signaling in bacteria is the most well studied form of QS, but this phenomenon is under-studied in nitrifying bacteria. QS has only been briefly studied in two ammonia oxidizers, and our group only recently identified acyl-HSL production in a nitrite oxidizer. I hypothesize one mechanism of establishing and maintaining nitrification coupling is that ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers communicate by acyl-HSL QS and this modifies their transcriptomes and physiology. I plan to investigate this phenomenon using the model nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea (an ammonia oxidizer) and Nitrobacter winogradskyi (a nitrite oxidizer), two nitrifying bacteria that produce similar chemical signals. I will confirm the identity of chemical signals (acyl-HSLs) used by these microorganisms to communicate and use a novel lactonase enzyme that prevents QS by depleting chemical signals to investigate the effects of QS during pure and co-culture of these nitrifying bacteria. Next-generation sequencing technology (mRNA-seq) will be used to identify the purpose of QS in these organisms and determine if it plays a role in nitrification. Finally, the project will determine how common QS is in nitrifying bacteria by screening other diverse nitrifying bacteria for acyl-HSL production in collaboration with other investigors in the field. The data obtained from these studies will be disseminated to the scientific community via scholarly publications and communicated to the general public via guest lectures in college and high school classes, as well as through outreach via public science lectures (OMSI science pub) and/or college radio interview programing (KBVR Inspiration Dissemination). Understanding QS in nitrifying bacteria could allow future scientists to control the flow of nitrogen in agricultural systems.","The process of nitrification has a broad influence on modern agriculture, water quality, and production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.

Wheat production has been continually threatened by various biotic and abiotic stresses. There is a constant need to find and deploy new genes in wheat to strengthen its defense against new threats. However, wheat has limited genetic variability due tothe nature oforigin, which has increasingly become a bottleneck for wheat improvement. It is essential to bring new genes into wheat to expand its genetic variability. The wild grass relatives of wheat represent an invaluable gene pool for wheat improvement. Favorable genes of wild grass relatives can be incorporated into wheat by ph1b mutant-induced homoeologous meiotic recombination. However, the ph1b mutant, originally developed in the old Chinese wheat landrace &#39;Chinese Spring&#39; (CS) with poor agronomic characteristics, has not been deployed in most classes of US wheats. Here we propose to deploy the ph1b system in the US wheat and build an effective pipeline of gene flow from wild grasses into US wheats. The specific objectives of this project are to: 1) Incorporate CS ph1b mutant into US wheats for homoeologous recombination-based geneintrogression (HRBGI);and 2) Develop ph1b mutant-specific molecular markers to improve the efficacy of the mutant inHRBGI.Ultimately, this research will enable US wheats for HRBGI and create an operative entrance of alien genes into US wheats for germplasm and variety development.","Wild relatives of wheat represent an invaluable gene reservoir for wheat improvement. One of the approaches for expanding the genetic variability of wheat is to bridge gene flow from the wild relatives into wheat by inducing meiotic recombination between homoeologues of wheat and the relatives. Wheat, however, has a defense system against homoeologous meiotic pairing/recombination, which is controlled predominantly by the Ph1 (pairing homoeologous) gene on the long arm of chromosome 5B (5BL). The Ph1 gene prevents homoeologous chromosomes from pairing and recombining in meiosis, and therefore restricts homoeologous recombination-based gene introgression (HRBGI). Over the last few decades, the Ph1-controlled defense system has been manipulated to induce homoeologous pairing/recombination for gene introgression from wild grasses into wheat. A large deletion (~70 Mb) encompassing the Ph1 locus on 5BL, designated ph1b, was generated by X-ray irradiation in the old Chinese common wheat landrace &#39;Chinese Spring&#39; (CS) with poor agronomic characteristics. Deletion of the Ph1 locus, i.e. ph1b mutant, induces meiotic pairing and recombination between homoeologues of wheat and related wild grasses. The ph1b mutant has been widely used in HRBGI from wheat-related grass species into wheat. However, the unadapted CS background and the laborious process of removing the ph1b deletion from resultant homoeologous recombinants have limited the efficacy of this mutant in gene introgression and germplasm development. Theprimarygoals of this project are to develop an effective ph1b system in the US wheat for homoeologous recombination-based gene introgression (HRBGI) from wheat-related wild grass species directly into major classes of US wheats and todevelop ph1b deletion-specific molecular markers for quick identification/removal of the deletionin theresultant homoeologous recombinants for germplasm development. The specific objectives of this project are to:Incorporate CS ph1b mutant into five classes of US wheats for HRBGI; and 2.

Vespula pensylvanica is of particular agricultural significance because it preys on, robs honey from, competes with, and likely shares pathogens with honeybees and native pollinators. A multi-queen, perennial colony phenotype is currently common only in introduced populations in Hawaii, where it has tremendous ecological impact and poses a threat to pollinator populations. Through field experiments and chemical analyses, we will determine how behavioral and chemical changes have led to this shift in social organization, allowing us to better predict when social insects will undergo similar transitions following future climate or range shifts. We will determine pathogen overlap with honeybees to assess this species&#39; potential to function as a pathogen vector or reservoir in apiculturally important regions. Finally, we will use field experiments, lab assays and molecular genetics to test the hypothesis that the transition to perenniality is influenced by wasp self- medication via honey robbing from feral honeybees, with implications for managing this novel perennial phenotype. These results will inform the maintenance of pollinator services in the face of global change, with implications for plant and animal production.","Global change presents a challenge to agricultural and environmental stability. Climate change and species introductions can result in dramatic phenotypic shifts in economically and ecologically important species. A classic example is the novel social and reproductive phenotypes of invasive social ants and wasps. Many of the most damaging invasive ant species exhibit some form of supercoloniality: a relaxation of colony boundaries and the loss of intraspecific aggression. The transition to this social phenotype likely exaggerates the ecological effects of these invasions. In a surprising parallel to ant supercoloniality, recent genetic work has shown that an invasive yellowjacket wasp (Vespula pensylvanica) in Hawaii exhibits polygyny (multiple reproductive queens per colony) likely established through foreign nest-joining by unrelated queens, phenomena that are extremely rare in the native range. This polygyny is almost certainly a prerequisite for the perennial colony structure that is relatively common in Hawaii, though very rare in the native range of the western United States. The perennial colony phenotype magnifies the ecological impact of this species because colonies grow to enormous size and consume and displace a diverse array of arthropods, including native pollinators and honey bees, year-round. However, polygyny is not sufficient to induce perenniality in most colonies, as only approximately 20% of colonies overwinter in a given year. Remarkably, unpublished data demonstrate that this novel life-history phenotype only arises in colonies situated within 200m of feral honeybee hives, suggesting that interactions with honeybees are an ecological driver of perenniality in Hawaiian Vespula.Integrating manipulative field experiments and chemical analyses, the first two objectives of the proposed project will assess the behavioral mechanisms underlying the shift to polygyny in the invasive range. The last two objectives will assess the potential for this honeybee associate to act as a pathogen vector to pollinators and will use field experiments to elucidate potential causal links between the damaging yellowjacket perennial phenotype and proximity to honeybees. With these results we will gain valuable insights into the causes of social transitions in invasive social insects. Such data will help predict future shifts resulting from invasions and climate change, as well as determine the role of yellowjacket wasps in the pathogen networks of pollinators.Objective 1: Use behavioral experiments to quantify and compare non-nestmate rejection behavior in V. pensylvanica colonies from invasive and native ranges in order to understand the mechanisms that result in the queen joining that leads to perennialityObjective 2: Use chemical analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons to determine the chemical cue variability that separates colonies, in both the invasive and native ranges, and compare the variability between native and invasive rangesObjective 3: Use genetic markers to detect common microbial pathogens of Vespula pensylvanica in the introduced range (Hawaii) and native range (California), and determine the pathogen species overlap with honeybees Objective 4: Determine whether the presence of nearby honeybee colonies influences yellowjacket perenniality due to (1) the availability of carbohydrates in the form of robbed honey, or (2) a decrease in pathogen load resulting from consumption of carbohydrates with antimicrobial properties, again in the form of robbed honey.","Vespula, behavior, honeybees, invasive species, pathogens, phenotypic plasticity, pollinators"

In one approach, biomass can be deconstructed to sugars, which are then fermented by microorganisms to produce the biofuel. However, the amount of biofuel at the end of the fermentation is often too low for industrial purposes. I hypothesize that individual enzymes responsible for converting the sugar to biofuel have poor kinetic properties, and that this limits the amount of biofuel that can be produced. I have developed a new method to efficiently test tens of thousands of enzymes to find the few that have improved kinetics. The ultimate goal of this project is to use my method to improve the production of the important biofuel isobutanol from sugar. If successful, will demonstrate this powerful approach to increase the amounts of other biofuels used for diesel and jetfuel.","The goal of the research component of this project is to demonstrate and extend the enzyme sequence-function mapping method to optimize enzymes within longer fermentative pathways.

PROJECT,SAES - MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1008020,2016-67017-24514,Mechanistic Uptake of Chemicals of Emerging Concern by Vegetable Crops from Water and Soil,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,474948.0,"Li, HU.",ACTIVE,"Background. Consumption of pharmaceutical-tainted fresh produce, especially raw vegetables, represents a direct route of human exposure to chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). The major sources for human and veterinary pharmaceuticals that accumulated in vegetables can be tracked to the agricultural lands and irrigation water containing CECs. Land application of biosolids derived from livestock manures and sewage sludges, and agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water, are the major practice responsible for the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in fresh produce including vegetables. Although the pharmaceuticals typically found in fresh produce are usually below acceptable levels for daily intake, consumption of agricultural produce containing antibiotics could plausibly increase the populations of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the intestinal tracks of human and animals. Mitigating the accumulation of antibiotics in fresh produce during agricultural production is a crucial first step in improving food safety, which surely reduces human exposure to antibiotics. However, currently it is unclear how pharmaceuticals move into vegetables during growth, and the extent to which they accumulate. A better understanding the mechanism of vegetable uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals from soil and water will enable the development of scientifically-informed management practice that can help vegetable producers ensure food safety by minimizing or eliminating pharmaceuticals in fresh produce.Overall Hypothesis. The overarching objective is to elucidate the mechanism of pharmaceutical uptake by vegetables growing in water-soil systems. We hypothesize that pharmaceutical translocation to vegetables is controlled water flow in both soils and plants. Pharmaceutical accumulation depends on vegetable type, interaction of pharmaceuticals with plant tissue constituents, and the growth conditions.Specific Aims. (1) Screen and rank the uptake of multiple representative human and veterinary pharmaceuticals by selected vegetables (carrot, celery, cucumber and lettuce). (2) Evaluate sorption by vegetables and growth factors influencing the rate and magnitude of pharmaceutical uptake and accumulation in vegetables. (3) Assess the influence of pharmaceutical sorption/desorption in soils on the uptake by vegetable roots. (4) Investigate novel soil management and irrigation practices designed to minimize pharmaceutical accumulation in vegetables.Approaches. Vegetable uptake of representative pharmaceuticals will be investigated using both hydroponic and soil-pot experiments. Pharmaceuticals in plant tissues, soil and water will be extracted and quantitated by LC-MS/MS using the methods developed and used in our laboratory. The kinetics and magnitude of pharmaceutical uptake will be measured, and related to physicochemical properties of the pharmaceuticals, sorption by plant constituents, and with water flow in both soils and vegetables. In the pot experiments soils with different sorptive constituents (e.g. organic matter, clays) and textures will be used to delineate the role of sorption and water flow in influencing pharmaceutical accumulation in vegetables.Potential Impact and Expected Outcomes. New fundamental understanding is needed for mitigating uptake and accumulation of pharmaceuticals in fresh produce and vegetables. The results from this research project will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences and outreach events in order to effectively transfer the knowledge to scientific communities, food producers, industries, policy makers, and the general public. Such knowledge helps guide vegetable producers to develop scientifically informed management practices that ensure food safety during the production phase, and ultimately to minimize chemical hazards in the fresh produce delivered to the public.","Our overarching objective is to elucidate the mechanism(s) governing the uptake of pharmaceuticals from water and soil by vegetables. This knowledge will facilitate the development of best management practices to mitigate the accumulation of CECs in vegetable fresh produce. The proposed project directly addressesphysical or molecular mechanisms that allow foodborne hazards of pharmaceuticals to internalize into fresh produce. Consumption of pharmaceutical-tainted fresh produce, especially raw vegetables, represents a direct route of human exposure to CECs. The trace levels of pharmaceutical mixtures in fresh vegetable produce might adversely affect human health. Moreover, antibiotics (one major class of pharmaceuticals proposed for study) could exert selective pressure on native antibiotic resistant populations of bacteria in human and animal gastrointestinal tracks hence accelerating the development and proliferation of antibiotic resistance. Reducing uptake of CECs by vegetables during agricultural production is a key step in improving food safety. Surely, reduced uptake by vegetables reduces human exposure to pharmaceuticals in natural environments.Little is known about the mechanism of pharmaceuticals movement into vegetables from soil and water. Here, our central hypothesis is that water flow in soils and vegetables is the major process by which pharmaceuticals translocate from soil and water to vegetables. The accumulation of pharmaceuticals depends on vegetable types, plant tissue constituents and growth condition, physicochemical properties of CECs, and soil properties. Mitigating uptake of CECs by vegetables could be achieved by reducing CEC concentrations in soil water flowing into vegetables. To test this hypothesis, and to achieve our overall research goals, we propose the following four specific aims:(1) Quantify and rank the uptake of multiple representative human and veterinary pharmaceuticals by selected vegetables (carrot, celery, cucumber and lettuce)(2) Evaluate which vegetable organs (roots, leaves etc.) and growth factors most significantly influence the rate and magnitude of pharmaceutical uptake and accumulation in vegetables(3) Assess the influence of pharmaceutical sorption/desorption by soils on their uptake via vegetable roots(4) Discover and investigate novel soil management and irrigation practices that minimize pharmaceutical accumulation in vegetables.","Vegetable uptake, antibiotics, food safety, pharmaceuticals, soil, water"
PROJECT,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT RIV,1008025,2016-67011-24638,A Feasibility Study of the Potential of Semi-Arid Energy Crop Agave for Conversion to Bioethanol,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,39500.0,"Lu, MA.",ACTIVE,"Biofuels are becoming increasingly indispensable as a replacement for fossil fuels. While fossil fuels are finite and contribute to significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biofuels, especially those derived from lignocellulosic (fibrous and inedible) biomass, are renewable, sustainable, and friendlier to the environment. High production cost, however, has hindered their commercialization. The pathway to commercialization is even more challenging in light of the recent plummeting crude oil prices, which render biofuels less competitive. This research project will investigate the potential of a plant genus agave to overcome the barriers in bioethanol production from biomass. Agave is a promising feedstock candidate for low-cost biofuel production because it is less water demanding and recalcitrant to conversion. These advantages may translate to reduced feedstock costs and a simpler conversion step, both of which could result in significant biofuel savings. To determine the potential of agave for biofuel production, this research will establish its actual ethanol yields using different processing arrangements. Subsequent optimization of a reaction involving a single step processing of agave to bioethanol would further lower capital expenditure. This is followed by an economic evaluation to determine the viability of the optimized process. By studying the technical and economic feasibility of converting agave to bioethanol, this project seeks to promote a potentially competitive biofuel production from a sustainable and renewable resource, a goal that would help address the energy needs and climate change facing the nation.","The goal of this project is to determine the viability of a low-cost biochemical pathway for the conversion of a drought resistant plant, specifically agave, to transportation fuel. The successful development of a single hydrolysis and fermentation step could potentially lead to the accomplishment of the ideal biochemical conversion process for lignocellulosic biomass: the utilization of a single reactor without pretreatment at low temperature. Not only would this result in high cost savings; it would also boost the commercialization potential of agave for bioethanol production.To fulfill this goal, the following objectives are pursued:Assess ethanol yield of California agave species using various process configurations of increasing simplicity (that would lower capital costs) involving enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the juice and bagasse.Optimize the ethanol yield of the simplest process configuration (lowest capital costs) by varying critical variables, such as reaction temperature and time and enzyme loadings.Evaluate the economics (i.e., capital expenditure (capex), operating expenses (opex), and minimum ethanol selling price (MESP)) of the optimized simplest process configuration to determine its feasibility.","agave, bioethanol, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, techno-economic"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,1008037,2016-67013-24453,Improving Alfalfa Yield by Modulating Autumn Dormancy,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,350000.0,"Brummer, ED.",ACTIVE,"Alfalfa provides high quality animal feed and offers numerous environmental benefits to farming systems, including nitrogen fixation, control of soil erosion, and disruption of pest and weed cycles. Yield is a critical trait for alfalfa, yet long selection cycles due to the perennial nature of the plant limit genetic gain. Total annual yield can be increased by modulating fall dormancy so that plants grow into the autumn and early winter and begin growth early in spring. This extended growing season enhances total production. Identifying the genetic factors that control fall dormancy can facilitate the manipulation of dormancy to maximize the productive season of alfalfa, particularly in southern locations in the US where winter is mild. In this project, I intend to build on preliminary genetic mapping research in which we identified genetic markers affecting dormancy. I will also take advantage of a set of divergently selected populations that contrast for fall dormancy to identify further markers using genotyping-by-sequencing. The contrasting populations have been developed from cultivars throughout the dormancy spectrum, making any markers identified particularly useful for selecting in elite breeding populations. Together, these markers will enable the targeted manipulation of particular genes affecting autumn growth and help adapt new germplasm to breeding programs. This could facilitate the development of high-yielding cultivars.","We hypothesize that a relatively small number of genes control autumn (fall) dormancy in alfalfa, that we can identify these genes based on allele frequency shifts during selection and through genetic mapping, and that we can develop predictive equations using whole-genome markers with targeted QTL markers to estimate the fall dormancy level of alfalfa plants. A straightforward means to manipulate dormancy using marker-assisted selection would enable breeders to adapt novel germplasm to new environments, opening the potential for additional yield gain by capturing yield heterosis in population hybrids.Specific Research Objectives:We will build on our ongoing research into fall dormancy and yield to:Objective 1. Identify markers associated with fall dormancy using previously developed populations selected for more or less dormancy,Objective 2.

PROJECT,RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW,1008068,2016-68003-24601,Evaluating Different Manure Management Practices In Controlling Spread Of Antimicrobial Resistance From Dairy Farms,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,999921.0,"Aga, DI, S..",ACTIVE,"The dairy industry is one of the most important agricultural businesses in the United States and is the number one agricultural business in California, Wisconsin and New York. In modern dairy farms, antimicrobials are commonly used for both therapeutic (disease treatment) and prophylactic (prevention) purposes. However, the use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture has been associated with increased occurrence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB) and the presence of antimicrobial resistant genes (ARG) in dairy manure, which enter the human food chain when manure is used to fertilize croplands. This proposed integrated research and extension project seeks to evaluate critical control points in dairy farm operations that can prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance from ""farm to fork"". Our study is based on 11 participating dairy farms that include small, medium, and large animal feeding operations employing various manure management strategies such as anaerobic digesters (with and without composting or pasteurization), solid-liquid separation, and long-term or short-term lagoon storage systems. The effectiveness of advanced manure treatment systems in reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance will be evaluated through coordinated bench-scale and pilot-scale experiments to identify important manure characteristics and digester operating parameters for optimum removal of antimicrobials, ARB, and ARG. Plant-uptake experiments will be conducted to determine if certain types of manure treatment systems, combined with appropriate manure application in crop fertilization, can prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance from ""farm to fork"". We will also evaluate whether general farm hygienic measures can potentially reduce the use of antimicrobials. Results from the different aspects of this study will be incorporated into a predictive model to simulate the proliferation of ARB and ARG at the watershed-scale.Our research and extension efforts are unique in that they are based on a strong partnership between academic researchers, extension specialists, and commercial dairy operations implementing varying manure treatment systems, which will allow us to directly relate laboratory studies with farm-scale conditions. The knowledge gained from this research will improve the scientific understanding of the role of anaerobic digestion technology and manure composting on mitigating the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Improvements in manure treatment and farming practices (e.g. antimicrobial use, cleanliness of farms, animal health management, manure application) will result from our planned extension and education activities that will include field days and workshops. Ultimately, specific abatement strategies and best management practices (e.g. type of manure treatment and applications, selection of crops grown in specific manure-amended fields) will result in the reduction of antimicrobial use in the animal industry, and ultimately spread of antimicrobial resistance in agricultural environment.","The major goals of this project are to: (1) evaluate and test conditions for effective and sustainable strategies that mitigate the spread and persistence of ARB and ARG within the agricultural ecosystem, from farm to food crops, and (2) design training, education, and outreach resources (including web-based resources) that can be used by farmers, operators, and policy makers to prevent spread of antimicrobial resistance from farm to fork. The objectives of this project are:Evaluate the fate and removal rates of antimicrobials, ARB, and ARG in conventional and advanced manure treatment systems at 11 dairy farms and in manure-amended soil.Through coordinated bench-scale and pilot-scale AD experiments, identify the driving manure characteristics and AD operating parameters for maximizing removal of antimicrobials, ARB, and ARG from manure.Quantify the amounts of antimicrobials, ARB and ARG that can be transferred from manure-amended soil to human food crops, using different crops and manure treatment.Utilize a watershed-scale hydraulic model to determine antimicrobial transfer from cow to manure to fields, crops and end of field (i.e. streams and ditches) with the three different manure management strategies to ascertain which management strategies have the largest effect and should be the focus of extension activities.Develop accessible extension and education activities to convey the importance of manure management strategies, food system interactions, antimicrobial use, and farm cleanliness in order to mitigate antimicrobial resistance to specific target audiences.","Antibiotic resistance genes, anaerobic digestion, antimicrobials, dairy farms, manure management"

However, the ability of legumes to fix nitrogen may be limited due to attack from pathogens or insects. Conversely, growers might be able to promote insect and disease resistance in plants by managing soil rhizobia. To elucidate the relationships between insects, viruses, rhizobia, and nitrogen fixation in legumes, we will accomplish two objectives: (1) determine the impacts of insect pests and viral pathogens on biological nitrogen fixation in legume crops, and (2) investigate how rhizobia and nitrogen fertilizers influence insect and pathogen resistance in legumes. Our study system consists of field pea, a common rotational crop in the USA, two insect pests (pea aphid; pea leaf weevil), a viral pathogen (pea-enation mosaic virus), and the bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,1008241,2016-67013-24460,Genomic Recombination Landscape of Common Bean in Relation to Drought- and Heat-Tolerance and Other Traits of Agronomic Importance,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,350000.0,"Gepts, PA.",ACTIVE,"Among legume crops, common bean is the most important crop for direct human consumption. This direct consumption means that consumers actually see the harvested product (grains, pods, leaves, or flowers, in the case of beans) before it gets processed (i.e., cooked, steamed, grilled, popped, etc.). Over time and locations, cultural preferences have become established regarding the characteristics of these products regarding size, shape, and color. Likewise, farmers expect certain characteristics of bean plants that make them fit into their cropping system, such as growth habit (e.g., bush vs. climbing) and phenology (e.g., early vs. late). From a breeding standpoint, this situation means that a significant part of the genome may already be ""fixed"". The genes coding for the traits determining farmer and consumer preferences have to be selected during the breeding process to recover these traits. Through linkage, not only these genes but adjacent regions will be selected as well. How big a genomic region will be fixed depends on the distribution of recombination around these genes, which in turn depends on their location on the bean chromosomes. The smaller the region, the easier it will be to recombine fixed traits with other desirable traits such as tolerance to heat and drought stresses, yield, and phenology. In contrast, large areas fixed by selection and relative lack of recombination will make the combination of desirable traits more difficult to achieve. In this project, we will investigate the distribution of recombination on the 11 chromosomes of common bean, especially in relation to the cultural and agronomic traits mentioned above. To achieve this, a large multi-parent, multi-generation (MAGIC) population was established, which includes some 960 lines. This population will be characterized in two ways. First, it will be sequenced to determine the DNA sequences of each line and the recombination distribution will be determined. Second, the same population will be characterized in the field for all the phenotypic traits mentioned above. Genotypic and phenotypic data will then be combined to determine the fixed part of the genome. Furthermore, we will then determine to what extent the genes for drought tolerance and other agronomic traits fall in this fixed genome part. The smaller the overlap, the more favorable the situation. In contrast, a large overlap suggests that breeding for drought tolerance will be more difficult to achieve and special breeding methods, such as additional recombination need to be followed.","Goal: Describe the genomic recombination landscape of common bean in relation to drought and heat tolerance and other traits of agronomic importance.Objective 1: Genotype an established MAGIC population of common bean Building on the results of a GBS analysis of the parents conducted especially for this proposal, we propose to sequence the ~ 960 progeny lines by GBS to establish a genome-wide haplotype for each of the lines. Sequencing results will undergo a bioinformatic analysis to clean and characterize the sequences obtained for the 8 parental genotypes and placing them on the common bean reference sequence to determine their physical location (Schmutz et al. 2014).Objective 2: Evaluate the field performance of the MAGIC population The MAGIC population will be evaluated in field conditions at the UC Davis Plant Sciences farm in two years aunder well-watered and drought-stressed conditions to evaluate the stress tolerance and potential water use efficiency of each line.Objective 3: Joint statistical analysis of genotypic and phenotypic results obtained in Objectives 1 and 2. A genetic map will be constructed in this population and a QTL analysis will be performed for drought tolerance and other traits agronomic traits. This will provide us with information on the genome location of genes or QTLs, for example, whether they are located in areas with high or low recombination and will help breeders evaluating to what extent recombination can separate superior alleles currently in repulsion.Objective 4: Preparation of public release of deliverables of this project.To assure public release of deliverables (See Section VI), sets of small seed samples will be made available for the MAGIC population and larger seed quantities for select high-performing progeny lines.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,1008448,2016-67013-24812,Understanding the regulatory circuit of type III secretion system in Erwinia amylovora,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499930.0,"Zhao, YO.",ACTIVE,"The apple and pear industry in the U.S. and around the world has been devastated by fire blight disease, caused by the plant pathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora. The discovery of resistance to streptomycin, an effective antibiotic that targets the floral infection of the pathogen, resulted in the critical need for developing novel sustainable control strategies. The situation is especially dire for organic production for transition from antibiotic to non-antibiotic options. The pathogen E. amylovora utilizes a needle-like structure, called the hypersensitive and pathogenicity (hrp)-type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into host plants to suppress host defense, acquire nutrients and cause disease. It is believed that disabling T3SS function among gram-negative bacterial pathogens may provide a unique way of controlling bacterial disease. Hence, T3SS has become the main target in drug discovery by finding inhibitors that disable the function of T3SS, which could possibly be used as a novel class of antibacterial agents, which is in critical need. The project is designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of E. amylovora by comprehensively examining the regulatory circuit of T3SS. Our central hypothesis is that the bacterial alarmone (ppGpp) signaling-dependent sigma factor regulatory circuit at the transcriptional level and RNA binding protein RsmA at the post transcriptional level are critical in swiftly regulating the T3SS, promoting its survival under stress conditions, and causing disease. Our hypothesis is that E. amylovora senses host/environmental signals and utilizes the alarmone signaling pathway as an intracellular molecular ""switch"" to control sigma factor activities, ensuring that the T3SS functions at appropriate time to activate nutrient acquisition mechanisms. We believe that this comprehensive approach in understanding the regulatory circuit of T3SS in E. amylovora represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in bacterial pathogens during susceptible interactions. Defining the molecular ""switch"" of T3SS will be a breakthrough for controlling bacterial diseases via this key bacterial virulence mechanism.","Our long-term goal is to comprehensively understand the function and regulation of T3SS and use this knowledge to develop agents to curb bacterial infection. The purpose of this project is to comprehensively understand the regulatory circuit of T3SS in E. amylovora by characterizing ppGpp-mediated RpoN/HrpL-dependent transcription regulation of T3SS, determining the signals that activate the stringent response and T3SS; examining the crosstalk between RsmA and ppGpp in activating RpoN-HrpL sigma factor cascade; and examining the regulatory circuit of RsmA and RpoN-HrpL sigma factor cascade in E. amylovora. A better understanding of alarmone signaling-mediated regulation in response to nutrient stress and the associated T3SS activation will ultimately lead to the development of improved disease management strategies.","erwinia amylovora, t3ss, virulence regulation, RsmA, alarmone signaling, ppGpp"

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,1008486,2016-67012-24676,Understanding the coevolutionary dynamics of obligate insect symbiosis using pea aphids,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,149952.0,"Chong, RE, A.",ACTIVE,"Symbiotic relationships between bacteria and animals play a key role in generating and maintaining biodiversity in all ecosystems. Many plant species are significantly impacted by sap feeding insects, which are able to subsist on a nutritionally unbalanced diet of plant sap with the aid of symbiotic bacterial partners that live within specialized cells of their insect hosts. After millions of years of co-existence, some symbiotic relationships are now obligate where neither can exist without its partner. Though these relationships have persisted over time, little is known about what mechanisms allow for the coexistence between insects and bacteria. This research will investigate how insect hosts functionally regulate bacterial symbiont populations and will address to what extent these insects can tolerate and coexist with bacterial symbionts. This project will use experiments performed on laboratory populations of pea aphids, which harbor obligate symbiotic bacteria. In addition to experiments, this project will use new genomic and molecular technologies to determine to how pea aphids maintain their symbiotic bacteria. This project will provide key insights into the interactions of obligate symbionts with their insect hosts, which will extend current understanding of how symbiotic bacteria affect the ecological tolerance and geographic range of their hosts. Aphids are considered one of the most significant pestiferous and invasive insect species in North America. Thus, all experiments will be performed on a North American pest species. These results will provide new insight into how these pest species interact with microorganisms, and will provide critical information on the role of environmental change in the persistence of local pests and the potential emergence of novel pest species.","The major goal of this project is to understand how obligate insect symbioses are functionally regulated and what role symbioses play in the adaptation and diversification of insect hosts. The environmental and dietary flexibility of many pestiferous insect species are regulated by their obligate bacterial symbionts, which provision hosts with essential nutrients that are lacking from their specialized diets of plant phloem sap. These symbionts have highly reduced genomes that lack many regulatory genes and pathways; thus, hosts play a critical role in integrating and regulating symbiont function and symbiont numbers. These coordinated efforts are further complicated when hosts encounter variable environments that impact symbiont and host function and can ultimately influence the ability of symbiotic lineages to adapt. This raises important questions about how evolutionary forces interact to determine the evolutionary trajectory of symbiotic lineages. Using the obligate symbiosis of pea aphids as a model, the following supporting objectives will be undertaken: (1) determine the role of host and symbiont genotypes and their interactions in regulating symbiosis, (2) test whether rapid and degenerative evolution of symbiont genomes drives adaptation and diversification in host populations, and (3) determine how interactions between host and symbiont genotypes impact symbioses under different environmental and dietary regimes.In order to determine the role of host and symbiont genotypes and their interactions in regulating symbiosis, novel host-symbiont genotype combinations will be generated from several divergent, naturally occurring pea aphid clones using a new method that allows for experimentally replacement of native symbionts with divergent symbionts from donor aphid clones. Using high-throughput methods to sequence complete symbiont genomes and RNA sequence data (transcriptome) for host genes will allow for characterization of the novel genotypic combinations we generate in our crosses and transfers. Evaluating resulting symbiotic phenotypes and genotypes in a comparative framework will provide key insights into the role of host genotypes in regulating symbiosis. Additionally, the generation and characterization of novel pea aphid - Buchnera genetic combinations will allow for the evaluation of potential hybridization of divergent populations in nature that could give rise to lineages that are more or less fit than parental lineages.A combination of high-throughput genotyping and experimental manipulations will be used to test whether rapid and degenerative evolution of symbiont genomes drives adaptation and diversification in host populations, resulting in genetic incompatibilities within or between pea aphid populations. Specifically, genetic incompatibilities and associations between host and symbiont genotypes in the regulation of symbiosis will be tested for by sequencing progeny of reciprocal sexual crosses for which parental lines have divergent Buchnera genotypes. Clonal lineages that show evidence of pre- or post-zygotic isolation will be further tested using the symbiont replacement method, providing direct experimental tests of potential genetic incompatibilities. These results will provide insights into whether potential hybridization of divergent groups can produce new lineages with lower or higher fitness than parental lineages, or with novel properties enabling them to use new host plants, or invade new habitats.To determine how interactions between host and symbiont genotypes impact the regulation of symbiosis under changing environments and dietary regimes, novel combinations of pea aphid and Buchnera genotypes will be generated and their performance will be evaluated under different environmental conditions and on different diets. These results will provide insights into how interactions within and between host genotypes and symbiont genotypes determine a lineage&#39;s ability to adapt to different environmental conditions.","epistasis, mutualism, reproductive isolation, speciation, genetic incompatibilities"

Genetic improvement of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in crop plants will permit yield gains with lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs and energy use, offering both economic and environmental benefits. Maize (corn) is the world&#39;s leading grain crop used primarily as an animal feedstock for beef, poultry and pork production, as a food (including corn grain, starch, sugar and oil) and, in the US, the primary source of ethanol for the transportation sector. Currently, more nitrogen fertilizer is added to U.S. crop fields than plants can utilize. The excess nitrogen often ends up in waterways and ground water supplies, sometimes to unhealthy levels, necessitating the need for water purification. Excess nitrogen also contributes to algal blooms that choke out native species and marine animals. In developing countries, the expense associated with nitrogen fertilizers limits small sharholder&#39;s access reducing crop yields. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the efficient uptake of nitrogen fertilizers into the plant and remobilization to the grain will enable plant breeders and genetic engineers to develop more efficient crops that will use less fertilizer to produce more yield. To achieve these goals we will utilize traditional and emerging technologies to precisely engineer the genome of corn. This includes the use of naturally occurring transposable elements (jumping genes) that will ""knock-out"" genes involved in nitrogen use efficiency to study their impact on plant growth and development. This will include several genes predicted to play a role in both carbon and nitrogen metabolism: phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase1 (PEPCK1), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase2 (PEPCK2), aspartate aminotransferase1 (AspAT1) and aspartate aminotransferase2 (AspAT2). We will also explore the use of an emerging technology that will enable us to engineer a very specific change in single genes in the maize genome. This precision engineering technique known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR) has the potential to revolutionize plant science and drive the development of more nutritious, higher yielding and more heat and drought tolerant varieties. We will target two genes using this technology: 2-oxoglutarate/malate transporter1 (OMT1) and NADP-malate dehydrogenase (MDH). To more precisely characterize the effects of these induced changes on plant biochemistry, we are also employing new analytical techniques that will enable us to track the movement of carbon and nitrogen through the plant, between cells and even within cells. Collectively, these tools will provide a level of understanding we have not been able to achieve before and greatly facilitate the translation of these findings to improved crop performance.","1.

They are damaging to agricultural productivity, reducing output by consuming phloem sap and transmitting damaging plant viruses. When they are consuming phloem sap, aphids intermittently inject saliva into the plant to suppress defense responses and maintain nutrient flow to feeding sites. Prior research demonstrated that specific salivary proteins can mediate aphid-plant interactions. In a different approach that is yielding novel and interesting results, small molecules contained in aphid saliva are being investigated. Preliminary results suggest that aphids synthesize cytokinins, an important class of plant signaling molecules, and likely inject these metabolites into plants as components of their saliva. Cytokinins, which regulate leaf senescence and many other aspects of plant growth and development, may prolong the utility of aphid feeding sites. The proposed research will be directed at investigating the cytokinin biosynthesis pathway in aphids, the manner in which aphid-derived cytokinins influence maize, tomato, and Arabidopsis metabolism, and the possibility of using cytokinin inactivation as a means to control aphid infestations. By elucidating metabolic mechanisms through which green peach aphids maintain their feeding sites on plants, it will be possible to improve future pest control strategies. Given the similarities of insect feeding habits, knowledge gained from studying interactions between green peach aphids and their host plants will be broadly applicable to other agriculturally relevant plant-plant interactions.","Cytokinins are an important class of plant hormones that regulate many aspects of growth and development. Research with several species of plant-feeding insects, including aphids, has identified cytokinins in the insect bodies. However, it has not been conclusively determined whether the insects themselves are capable of cytokinin biosynthesis. The major goals of this project are to: (i) Confirm that aphids synthesize cytokinins, rather than accumulating them from their host plants. (ii) Investigate cytokinin metabolism in aphids and their endosymbionts. (iii) Determine the role of aphid-derived cytokinins in aphid-plant interactions.","aphid, cytokinin, hormone, Myzus Persicae, Saliva"

We propose to fill a gap in the policy debate and in the academic literature by carefully analyzing how different economic environment factors as well as consumers&#39; preferences influence consumers&#39; diet over time and across regions of the United States. In a first step, we propose to assemble a unique and rich brand-level database of consumer grocery purchases (quantities and prices), nutrition information and advertising intensities across the country and over time (a decade). Once assembled, we propose to apply an innovative econometric method that allows the recovery of parameters that describe consumers&#39; preferences for products&#39; nutrients, prices and advertising intensities. These parameters will be recovered at different periods of time and in different parts of the country. The main contribution of our econometric method rests on its ability to isolate the role of consumer preferences from all other elements that might influence dietary choices (product offerings, nutrient composition, prices, and advertising).Estimates from our method will then allow us to ask the counterfactual question of whether consumption would differ significantly if consumers in one region (or one time period) were exposed to firms&#39; strategies (prices, product offerings, nutritional content, and advertising) observed in a different part of the country (or a in different year). The policy relevance of these econometric exercises is that they can be used to produce quantifiable predictions on the effectiveness of different scenarios for reducing unhealthful eating. For instance, we can evaluate effects of limiting (or banning) certain unhealthy ingredients (or advertising), restricting (or taxing) certain products or, alternatively, focusing on changing consumers&#39; preferences towards certain types of consumption. By being able to separate the role of consumer preferences from all other factors that influence diet choices, we will be able to shed light on the highly-debated issue of whether policy formulations should focus on the consumer or the firm side.","Our overarching goal is to inform public health policy by uncovering which factors most determine diet in the United States today. We propose to disentangle the influence of supply-side factors, namely the choices that firms in the food market make regarding product offerings, pricing, and advertising, from the influence of demand-side factors, namely, consumer choices about what to buy and eat.

Beekeepers currently experience unsustainable colony losses, losing 30% of their colonies over the winter and 45% annually. These high losses are due in part to poor nutrition, increased pesticide contamination, and queen losses. Neonicotinoids have received the most attention in the press, but they rarely appear in colony food stores. In stark contrast fungicide contamination is abundant, but the risks to colony health are poorly understood. Fungicides may negatively impact colony wide nutrition by killing the beneficial microorganisms in stored pollen that help make this protein source more nutritious. Honey bee colonies also replace poor quality queens and this turnover is linked with increased colony mortality. Improving larval nutrition of queens could significantly reduce queen turnover and thus colony losses. My proposal outlines three experiments on colony nutrition:1) Fungicide Impacts on Colony Health: determine the impact of fungicides on honey bee health.2) Determine if larval pheromones indicate future queen potential: examine if a natural chemical signal given off by young larvae stimulates queen rearing.3) Improve Larval Queen Nutrition: determine if honey bee larvae supplemented with a natural chemical signal receive better larval nutrition and so improves the quality and longevity of the queen.By addressing these significant issues facing beekeepers, we improve colony health and reduce losses. This ensures a continuous supply of honey bee colonies for pollination in the United States, protecting America&#39;s agricultural independence and food security.","Objective 1: determine the impacts of fungicides on colony development. Beekeepers report experiencing increased colony losses shortly after pollinating high-fungicide crops, such as blueberries and watermelon. Currently fungicides are largely deemed safe for bees, but they may impact colony development if they disrupt the beneficial microbial communities in hives. Microorganisms make proteins, lipids and amino acids more available in stored pollen, potentially improving the nutrition of nurse bees, who canalize the protein into honey bee larvae. Disruptions to microbial colony symbionts may result in inadequate nurse bee nutrition and thus increased brood mortality and colony morbidity. Should fungicides prove harmful to colony health, beekeepers could trap incoming pollen in high-risk crops to protect colony health.Objective 2: improve larval queen nutrition. Colonies regularly replace poor quality queens, costing beekeepers money and time. These queen replacement events are significantly tied to colony losses, reducing the number of hives available for pollination. My PhD research suggests that e-beta-ocimene (e&beta;), the pheromone emitted by both young larvae and well-mated queens may be a ""feed me"" signal that results in increased feeding. We need a better understanding of how inadequate queen nutrition impacts queen longevity and replacement, and if naturally occurring pheromones can be used to augment queen quality by increasing larval nutrition","fungicides, honey bee, nutrition, pollen, pollination, queen quality, royal jelly"

Given these unique properties of rice G cycling, a previously-unknown mechanism for G protein activation for eukaryotes in general and for crop cereals in particular will be discovered upon completion of this project. Besides discovery of a novel mechanism for activation, this project will translate to improvements in US agriculture because important agronomic traits such as shoot and root architecture, drought and salt tolerance, and disease resistance are controlled through rice G protein activation. The aims are: Aim 1) Identify the endogenous rice regulator of G activation in a discovery-driven approach. Aim 2) engineer synthetic control of rice G cycling using a heterologous and a synthetic RGS protein in a hypothesis-driven approach. If we are successful reaching these two aims, then we will be in position to design a system to alter rice traits in the field when necessitated by a local change in condition.","Aim 1. Discover the primary system that regulates the activation state of G proteins in rice. As described above, in vitro, plant Ga subunits are 99% bound with GTP (active state). However, over-expression of a constitutively-active (GTPase-dead, thus GTP bound) G protein in rice22 and Arabidopsis23 confers growth phenotypes indicating that in vivo, the G protein pool cannot be 99% GTP bound. This means that there is a controllable mechanism to keep the plant G protein complex in its off state. Since its discovery, a lot of attention has been on the receptor-like 7TM RGS protein first found in Arabidopsis to be this controlling element but we no longer consider this protein to be the primary regulatory point. This is because null mutations in the Arabidopsis 7TM-RGS protein (AtRGS1) confer phenotypes that are not as severe as loss-of-function phenotypes of the G-protein complex mutants. Clearly, we have not yet found the primary mechanism by which the activation state of the plant G protein complex is regulated. That complex must physically interact with the Ga subunit in a nucleotide-dependent manner and therefore it can be co-immunoprecipitated for identification. -Aim 2. At least three lines of evidence described below support the conclusion that a 7TM RGS1 is a sugar-regulated GAP and that heterologous expression in rice will regulate the active state of RGA1 in a glucose-dependent manner. AtRGS1 is a 7TM RGS protein that has GAP activity on Ga, in Arabidopsis, yeast, and human (Gai1)23. AtRGS1 can GAP the rice Ga subunit but not as efficiently. An earlier version of this proposal described a work-around for the lower efficiency involving the mutation of a critical residue on the rice Ga. However, in the last year we found a universal RGS protein, one that has very high activity on both rice and Arabidopsis Ga subunits. We recently found that Setaria italica contains a poorly conserved RGS-domain protein (see Fig 6)5. We showed that this protein was acquired by horizontal gene flow 5 million years ago conferring a fitness advantage from the point of acquisition. That means it is most likely that the proposed expression of a synthetic receptor RGS protein in rice will operate on the existing rice G protein system.","growth, rice, signaling, G protein, abiotic and biotic stress"

Funds will also be used for the venue, i.e., auditorium use fee (Kellogg Conference Center) and the costs related to brochure, flyers, etc.Rapid, selective and sensitive detection technologies for animal pathogens, including zoonotic agents, are critical in clinical diagnosis, disease control, environmental monitoring and food safety. While traditional testing methods are still widely used in veterinary diagnostic laboratories for the detection of infectious agents of farm animals and wildlife, exciting new technologies, such as nanoparticle-based biosensors and PCR-microarray techniques, are being developed. In addition, nanotechnologies, although not yet implemented in veterinary laboratories, hold the promise of screening for numerous pathogens in a single assay. Other biotechnologies are likely to be widely used in the future as they can improve veterinary diagnostic capabilities while reducing the time and perhaps, the costs, associated with conventional technologies. This conference will dwell on some of these new technologies. Although a significant developmental work is still required, nanobiotechnology and its applications hold great promise for improving the speed and accuracy of diagnostics for veterinary pathogens.","This Conference proposal addresses one of AFRI&#39;s priorities within the 2014 Farm Bill, i.e., B.

According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, climate change (CC) will affect all four dimensions of food security: food availability; food accessibility; food utilization; and food systems stability. Impacts will be both short term, resulting from more frequent and more intense extreme weather events; and long term, caused by changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. Effects are already being felt in global food markets, in both rural and urban locations where supply chains are disrupted, market prices increase, assets and livelihood opportunities are lost, purchasing power falls, and human health is endangered.Despite the increasing understanding of the threats imposed by CC and the challenges it imposes to farming activities, surprisingly little research has been done to disentangle the effect of climatic variation on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in agriculture. Moreover, the policy response remains sluggish and specific actions taken on the ground are limited, even though policies designed to foster productivity, growth and sustainable farming practices that facilitate adaptation are of critical importance.In summary, it is reasonable to argue that climate change is likely to have severe effects on agricultural systems including productivity, and that major research efforts are needed to evaluate these effects. Thus, the research project proposed here will first attempt to deepen our understanding of the connection between TFP measures, climatic variability, technological change and irrigation. The project seeks to conduct a variety of simulations to evaluate the likely time paths of TFP and total output under different climatic patterns and water availability scenarios for the US as a whole and for individual states. In the process, we will investigate alternative model specifications and data configurations in order to determine the robustness of alternative models.","The long-term goal of the proposed study is to investigate the potential impact of climatic change on the productivity of U.S. agriculture both at the state and county levels, as well as a more focalized case study for Wisconsin and other states as data becomes available.

PROJECT,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,1007484,2016-67021-24413,Liquid molding Of wood strand panels with large curvature for automotive applications ¿ a sustainable solution,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,493761.0,"Yadama, VI.",ACTIVE,"Many segments of the forest products industry are in mature life cycle phases, are greatly dependent on the housing market, and are stagnant in terms of expansion and new market development. Development and investment in value-added specialties and novel manufacturing processes that cater to niche markets with high profit margins can help boost the industry and foster positive growth. There is a need to develop a sustainable manufacturing process (a process that is eco-friendly and could be established as a small-scale facility or be integrated into an existing operation, which is economically viable, reaches new markets, and promotes rural economic development) to mitigate environmental and social impacts of current practices, including resource exploitation, forest fires, climate change, and rural employment opportunities. Liquid molding technology, commonly used for synthetic fibers, provides an opportunity to develop a sustainable manufacturing infrastructure. Properly developed, it has the potential to convert underutilized lignocellulosic fiber from forest thinning for hazardous fuel reduction and fast growing short-rotation plantations into composite products of complex geometries for niche markets such as the automotive, marine, and aviation industry.Resin transfer molding (RTM) and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) are widely applied in manufacturing airplane and automobile interior composite products due to their cost-effectiveness. Today&#39;s automobile industry is under considerable pressure from societal and environmental concerns due to the relatively low fuel efficiency and disposal problems of synthetic fibers. Auto body and interiors are of 40% of the total vehicle weight, which indicates a promising way of improving the fuel efficiency. Developing lightweight materials for interiors provides a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency. However, lightweight materials like carbon fibers are expensive as compared to steel, urging the application of lower cost lightweight materials. Natural fiber (as a lower cost, renewable with low specific gravity and high specific strength and stiffness) has shown potential in automobile non-load-bearing component parts, such as door panels, seat backs and interior parts by European car manufactures. Wood strand composites have been used for decades as a cost effective replacement for solid structural lumber. Wood strand (as a cost-effective natural fiber) can be easily be formed and molded into automobile components as a panel with complex geometry and good surface finish using the RTM technology. Recent work has shown that wood strand composites can be formed into thin, geometrically complex panels. Liquid molding of wood strand composites may further improve this material form with improved surface finish and part stability. Preliminary forming studies of wood strand composites using compression molding and resin transfer molding suggests they could replace polymers in many applications due to their low cost, high specific strength and stiffness. Technological challenges such as preform fabrication, the influence of strand geometry on complex shapes, manufacturing methods for high production rates and material performance are needed for acceptance of this material form in the automotive industry.The objectives of the proposed study are to apply and develop the underpinning scientific principles of liquid molding technology, widely used with synthetic fibers, to produce wood strand composite panels for automotive interior parts. In the proposed work, compression resin transfer molding and vacuum assisted resin transfer molding will be investigated to understand the fundamentals of liquid molding large curvature and high-performance wood strand composite products for potential applications in the automotive industry. Meeting these objectives will identify the limits of mold shape, optimal locations and quantity of inlet and outlet resin ports, and resin viscosity requirements for automotive cure times and production rates. Benchmark properties of 3D wood strand panels produced using liquid molding will be established. A prototype automotive interior will validate the use of liquid molding as a viable technology to produce automotive composite panels product using wood strands. The positive impact of the outcomes of the proposed work is the development of an economically viable strategy, within the framework of a sustainable lignocellulosic fiber-based infrastructure in different regions of our country, for production of composite panels for new markets, such as the automotive and aerospace industries that demand high-performance and durable products.","The objective of this work is to identify the forming limits of three-dimensional wood strand composite structures using CRTM and VARTM for automotive applications.

Reuse of such previously under-utilized resources has important economic and environmental benefits, but also poses unknown risks to consumers due to the potential introduction of many contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) into food products. The perceived risks are the greatest for fresh produce such as vegetables and fruits that are often consumed raw. However, the occurrence and levels of CECs in vegetables and fruits under field conditions are essentially unknown, preventing assessment of the associated food safety. This project aims to improve food safety by evaluating emerging and under-researched chemical hazards in fresh produce. Specifically, we will first conduct greenhouse and cell-based experiments to develop a short list of CECs that have a high tendency for plant accumulation, and then measure the actual levels of these priority CECs in edible parts of common vegetables (lettuce, spinach, cabbage, celery, tomato, pepper, cucumber, radish, carrot, onions) and fruits (strawberries, melons, apple, citrus, avocado, plum) grown with treated wastewater irrigation or biosolid amendment in fields in Southern California. We will further use typical consumption values to estimate dietary intakes of CECs for different age groups and predict potential human exposure risks. Working with county-based farm advisors in California, we will actively extend science-based information to growers and the general public to promote safe reuse. This project contributes to a sustainable U.S. agriculture by promoting the use of treated wastewater and biosolids as valuable resources while safeguarding consumers.","The overall objective of this project is to obtain new information and knowledge on the uptake, accumulation and potential human dietary exposure of CECs in fresh produce including vegetables and fresh fruits when reclaimed water irrigation and biosolids are used in crop production, and to develop guidelines and science-based educational and outreach materials to inform stakeholders and end-users, thus minimizing the potential risks from such practices.

This trend may be desirable in promoting public health. However, recent surveys conducted in the United States have found high levels and incidences of ochratoxin A (OTA), a possible human carcinogen, in oat-based cereal products particularly in infant cereals. Several toxigenic fungi in the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium are known to contaminate agricultural crops and produce OTA. This potent mycotoxin has been regulated in other countries but no regulation or guideline for OTA in foods has been set in the United States. Most of the infant cereals are processed by using either indirect- or direct-steam heating, or extrusion cooking processes. Although processing could help reduce OTA, knowledge about the chemical transformation and residual toxicity of OTA in infant cereals as affected by commonly-used processing technologies has not been established. We propose to investigate the fate of OTA during the processing of oats using chemical analysis and toxicological evaluation of OTA and the degradation products formed. The proposed research will provide important data on the threat of OTA contamination in oat-based infant cereals and effective control strategies.

This creates tremendous burdens economically and environmentally because of energy costs of industrial N fixation, pollution, and eutrophication. There are intensive efforts and desire to develop crop plants that utilize N more efficiently. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the essential steps in plant uptake, transport, and assimilation of N. However, much less is known about signaling and regulatory events that modulate plant N utilization. A better understanding of the modulation can be applied towards designing crop plants that sense and utilize N more effectively. This project focuses on whether and how membrane lipids and associated enzymes modulate plant N utilization.The project will use soybean to determine the function of a specific group of phospholipase, PLD, providing opportunities to integrate basic knowledge with potential applications to increase crop production and quality. In addition, legume N2 fixation is the most important N source in agro-ecosystems. Thus, developing legume varieties with effective N2 fixation could have profound significance in improving agricultural sustainability. The project employs molecular, biochemical, cellular and whole-plant approaches towards improving N uptake, assimilation, accumulation, and/or utilization through studies in soybean and studies of plant-microbe interactions. It tests the hypotheses that PLD activity and membrane lipids modulate the nutrient-recycling, autophagic processes and plant N use efficiency. Potential conceptual breakthroughs from the study include revealing new mechanisms of regulation of autophagy, N remobilization, and N use efficiency. Also the study of soybean may offer an opportunity to determine how the lipid regulation of autophagy and N utilization impacts the tolerance of nodulation to soil N levels. An increased tolerance would allow increased N2 fixation in soils with a high residual level of N. Finally, manipulations of lipid regulated processes may lead to increased growth and seed production under N-limited conditions. Therefore, the proposed study addresses the program area: Plant Health and Production and Plant Products, particularly regarding the priority areas of Photosynthesis and Nutrient Use in Agricultural Plants (A1151).

Cows that succumb to subclinical hypocalcemia are more likely to develop other metabolic disorders and diseases that are common in early lactation dairy cows. The overall objective of the project aims to describe the contribution of serotonin to the regulation of calcium homeostasis in lactating dairy cows. We will use in vitro laboratory techniques combined with cow experiments to demonstrate that serotonin controls maternal calcium concentrations by regulating calcium transport and parathyroid hormone-related protein production in the mammary gland. Parathyroid hormone-related protein production is critical for calcium mobilization from bone. Serotonin has been shown to coordinate calcium transport and signaling in the mammary gland and is critical to regulating the communication between the bone and mammary gland during lactation. Therefore, dissecting the mechanisms by which serotonin regulates maternal calcium homeostasis will lead us to develop novel methods to prevent hypocalcemia. Current methods for the prevention of hypocalcemia in dairy cows are insufficient. Our project aims to improve the productivity and health of the dairy cow by reducing hypocalcemia during the periparturient period.

This will result in decreased metabolic disorders and culling, and increase animal productivity and health.The major goals of this project are:1) Directly evaluate the role of serotonin and the calcium sensing receptor in regulation of parathyroid hormone related-protein production and expression of calcium transporters in the bovine mammary gland epithelium;2) Determine the indirect effect of the serotonin-parathyroid hormone related-protein axis in response to subclinical hypocalcemia, and;3) Elucidate the contribution of the serotonin-parathyroid hormone related-protein axis to reduction of subclinical hypocalcemia and clinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows receiving a negative dietary cation-anion difference pre-calving.","bone, dairy cows, lactation, serotonin, transition"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA,1007737,2016-67017-24431,Bioactivity of curcumin and gut inflammation,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,480214.0,"Moreau, RE.",ACTIVE,"Inflammation promotes all steps of gastrointestinal cancer. Blocking inflammation through diet is a cost effective strategy to prevent early-stage carcinogenesis. For a long time, dietary polyphenols&#39; health properties were attributed to their antioxidant effects as free radical scavengers. However, a direct antioxidant activity of these compounds is very unlikely due to their low tissue concentrations. The new paradigm articulates that dietary polyphenols modulate cell signaling, interact with transcription factors, and consequently regulate gene expression. It would be through these mechanisms that curcumin, the principal polyphenol of turmeric, alleviates inflammation. Even when observed in vivo, polyphenols&#39; bioactivity may be one-or-two orders of magnitude lower than in vitro. The main reason and limitation remain the low bioavailability of most polyphenols. To achieve sufficient concentrations at their site(s) of action, consumed polyphenols must overcome multiple barriers, chief among them, the intestinal wall. Evidence indicates that piperine, one of the major components of black pepper, enhances the intestinal bioavailability of polyphenols; however, it is not yet known whether this approach promotes gastrointestinal health. A combination of cell culture assays and transgenic mouse studies will be employed to pursue the following objectives: 1) to determine whether curcumin + piperine synergize in the prevention of gut inflammation and carcinogenesis, and 2) to elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin + piperine protect against intestinal inflammation in relation to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein kinase involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis.This project will improve nutrition and health by addressing novel relationships between dietary polyphenols in foods and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, by generating key biomarker profiles for comparison with human data, and by comparing regulatory pathways in vitro and in vivo. The U.S. agriculture and food systems will benefit from our research as we anticipate that the knowledge generated by this project will help guide the development of food systems that valorize the combination of phenolics from different plant sources.","The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which bioactive food compounds modulate inflammation and promote enterohepatic health. Plant polyphenols are abundant micronutrients in our diet, and evidence for their role in health and disease has been recognized for nearly a century. Bioavailability differs greatly from one polyphenol to another, so that the most abundant polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those leading to the highest concentrations of parent compound and active metabolites in target tissues. Intestinal metabolism of polyphenols by enteric enzymes is responsible for polyphenol poor bioavailability. Inhibition of intestinal glucuronidation by piperine can be used to enhance polyphenol retention in intestinal epithelium. We will conduct the first experiments that will comprehensively characterize the benefits of combining two model dietary polyphenols, curcumin and piperine, on gut health. This project will improve nutrition and health by addressing novel relationships between dietary polyphenols in foods and inflammation in the gut, by generating key biomarker profiles for comparison with human data, and by comparing regulatory pathways in vitro and in vivo.Objective 1. To determine whether curcumin and piperine synergize in the prevention of gut inflammation and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. The objective will be completed by performing i) dose-response studies in intestinal epithelial cells, and ii) functional studies of gut inflammation and tumorigenesis in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowl disease (IBD) mice. We expect to find that curcumin bioactivity towards the remediation of gut inflammation and tumorigenesis will be enhanced by the combined intake of piperine above and beyond the sum of the components.Objective 2. To elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin versus curcumin + piperine protect against inflammation and improve intestinal health in a mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. The objective will be completed by feeding curcumin +/- piperine to mice lacking the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) gene in the intestinal mucosa and by determining gut permeability, tissue inflammation, and cancer biomarkers in DSS-treated IBD mice. It is expected that the enhancement of curcumin bioactivity afforded by the combined consumption of piperine will reverse the pathophysiological manifestations of mTORC1 hyperactivation in the gut.","cancer, colon, curcumin, inflammation, intestine, mtor, piperine"

Since nutrition represents an important factor affecting the intestinal environment, dietary incorporation of functional foods that prevent inflammation is a logical approach. Although few studies have demonstrated the anti-IBD properties of yogurt, there is scant information on the application of cheese in preventing inflammation. The increased consumption of cheese over yogurt, its versatility and presence of diverse bioactive components, make cheese an ideal dietary therapy for IBD. The therapeutic benefits of cheese are attributed to presence of starter lactic acid bacteria (SLAB), non-starter cultures (NSLAB) and other bioactive components. While some studies have investigated the functional role of NSLAB, anti-inflammatory effects of cheese and SLAB have not been examined. Additionally, use of NSLAB is associated with strain disparities and inconsistencies in the observed protective effects. Unlike NSLAB, SLAB are highly characterized, commercial cultures that offer consistency in their functional attributes. Therefore, this study will investigate the role of cheese and SLAB in preventing inflammation in vivo. Additionally, we will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of SLAB and cheese mediated protective action using genome-wide transcriptome analysis. Ultimately, completion of this research will provide a cheese-based adjunct dietary therapy for prevention of IBD. The long-term outcome of the study is improved public health and enhanced economic opportunities for the dairy industry, a key agricultural sector supported by USDA.","Our long term goal is to understand host-microbiome and probiotic interactions in health and disease. Elucidation of the bacterial cross-talk would help develop effective dietary interventions to prevent intestinal inflammation. As a first step towards achieving these goals, our objective in this application is to identify the role of cheese and cheese SLAB in preventing IBD. Our central hypothesis is that commercial cheese SLAB significantly enhance intestinal health through immunomodulation, maintenance of gut barrier integrity and intestinal microbial balance. Our hypothesis is based on published reports and our preliminary studies, in which we demonstrate that commercial cheese SLAB (Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus) alleviated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced inflammation in in vitro intestinal models (IEC-6 and Caco-2) by strengthening the gut barrier and inhibiting inflammatory mediator, NF-&kappa;B. The rationale for this study is that identification of the anti-inflammatory potential of cheese SLAB will help develop effective dietary interventions to prevent IBD, which, in turn will translate into significant reduction in chronic gut pathology. We are well prepared to undertake the proposed study with our research team that includes expertise in microbiology, dairy science, and bioinformatics. We plan to attain the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: Objective 1: Identify the role of low-fat cheese and cheese SLAB in preventing IBD in a mouse colitis model.

Salmonellosis and listeriosis outbreaks have not yet been attributed to produce contaminated at grocery retail likely due to the fact that risk of contamination at retail is essentially unknown and would likely result in sporadic cases. We hypothesize that retail produce storage, processing, and sales environments are potential niches for Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and L. spp and transmission to produce at retail is a significant public health risk, which could be reduced by targeted control strategies. We propose to (i) elucidate Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and other L. spp. contamination patterns and persistence in retail grocery, (ii) identify practices and store characteristics that differentiate high and low prevalence, and (iii) develop and test practical, feasible control strategies to reduce contamination and cross-contamination in retail produce environments. The outcomes from our study will provide critical information on prevalence and persistence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and other L. spp in retail produce environments and data necessary inform risk assessments for more reliable ranking of produce and retail food systems. This study addresses three program priorities in AFRI Foundational Program Improving Food Safety--A1331: dissemination of multiple foodborne hazards on fresh produce food contact surfaces associated with produce production or processing, characterization of under-researched foodborne hazards (i.e. retail produce environments), and development of control strategies for known foodborne hazards on previously unrecognized food vehicles or on foods that are not currently associated with a particular foodborne pathogen.","No studies have evaluated Salmonella or Listeria prevalence in retail produce storage, handling, and sales environments. Contamination can theoretically occur at any point in the farm-to-fork pipeline; however, the relative risk of contamination at each stage has not been determined. A study of fresh produce collected prior to retail found that just 0.58% of domestic fresh produce samples were positive for Salmonella (FDA, 2003), while 3.5% of imported fresh produce tested positive for Salmonella (FDA, 2001). While no studies on produce contamination levels at retail have been conducted in the U.S., a study of produce purchased from grocery stores in Spain found no Salmonella on uncut produce, but 0.8-10% of cut produce samples contained Salmonella and 0.8-3.4% of samples tested positive for L. monocytogenes (Abadias et al., 2008), suggesting that produce may have become contaminated during processing. A study of sprouts, pre-cut fruit, and unpasteurized juices from retail in the U.K. found no Salmonella present, but 5.2% of samples contained L. monocytogenes (Little et al., 2004). This study, however, did not compare to uncut produce, so it is impossible to determine how much contamination was present prior to processing at retail. Since even less is known about Salmonella and Listeria prevalence on U.S.-based produce and retail surfaces, this constitutes a major knowledge gap, which hinders the development of appropriate safety practices and standards. As leading experts in retail food safety research, we are positioned to conduct studies that enable regulatory agencies and the food industry to advance food safety practices, reduce the cost of foodborne illness, and improve public health. Therefore our specific objectives are to:Objective I. Elucidate Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and other L. spp. contamination patterns and persistence in retail grocery produce storage and sales environments.Objective II. Identify practices and store characteristics that distinguish produce storage and sales environments with low Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and other L. spp. prevalence from stores with high prevalence and evidence of persistence.Objective III. Develop, implement, and test practical and feasible control strategies in select establishments to (i) reduce Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in retail produce environments and (ii) reduce cross-contamination.Our long-term goal is to foundational data that will (i) assist in the identification of food safety hazards in produce at retail, (ii) elucidate effective and practice mitigation strategies to control L. monocytogenes and Salmonella in retail produce environments, and (iii) provide evidence needed to conduct further root-cause-analysis. Such analysis would identify factors and practices that contribute to increased foodborne pathogens in food handling environments beyond sanitation standard operating procedures (SSOPs) (e.g., investigate impact of food safety culture, training, and business practices).","listeria, prevalence, produce, retail, salmonella"

Though much is known about how to reduce the risk for developing this disease, there are still a large number of people who die from the disease despite taking advantages of all the suggested dietary and pharmaceutical approaches. Therefore, it is necessary to find new targets and approaches to treating and preventing cardiovascular disease. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is one such target. It is a known regulator of cardiovascular disease risk, yet little is known how it is regulated in the intestine, where it is expressed. We propose to determine how apoC-III is regulated in the intestine and whether diet can positively impact apoC-III in that tissue. We hypothesize that modulation of apoC-III in the intestine may be preferential to the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Both postprandial triglycerides and inflammation are well-established mediators of CVD. Of particular importance are macrophages, which are potent contributors to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, factors that influence both plasma triglycerides and macrophage activation are particularly important targets. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is one such target. It is an exchangeable apolipoprotein expressed in both liver and intestine; in humans, apoC-III levels in plasma are an independent predictor of CVD risk. ApoC-III is a potent regulator of plasma triglycerides through effects on lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipoprotein uptake, and VLDL secretion. ApoC-III also acts as a signaling molecule modulating vascular function. Though much is known about hepatic apoC-III, little is known about intestinal apoC-III (including the primary stimulus for its expression and its ability to influence macrophage activation). We have found that apoC-III is secreted from the intestine in response to dietary lipid, and that a fish oil-enriched diet lowers intestinal apoC-III RNA expression, as compared a butterfat diet. These findings are the first to link intestinal apoC-III expression with a dietary stimulus.The purpose of this proposal, therefore, is to: 1) define the role of dietary fat in regulating intestinal apoC-III and 2) determine how this regulation impacts macrophage activation. The goal is to determine how apoC-III expression in the intestine can be exploited by dietary strategies to prevent inflammation and CVD.We propose to accomplish these goals through the following objectives:1) Evaluate the role of dietary fat in modulating apoC-III expression, and subsequent impact on lipoprotein secretion.2) Determine how apoC-III expression changes impact macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to LPS.","apolipoprotein C-III, atherosclerosis, chylomicron, fish oil, inflammation, intestine"

Improving the efficiency at which animals convert feed into energy for production of meat and milk, known as feed efficiency, is important to the sustainability of beef production. Feed is converted to energy by microbes in the rumen, and differences in these microbes across animals can explain why some animals are more efficient feed utilizers than others. Microbes become present in the rumen starting at birth, and we hypothesize that there are several factors that influence which microbes occupy the calf&#39;s rumen. Our aim is to determine how a calf&#39;s genetic background, mother, and birth environment affect the microbes that inhabit the rumen, and how those microbes relate to the calf&#39;s performance in later life. We expect to determine the degree to which each of these factors influences the calf&#39;s rumen microbes, and ultimately the calf&#39;s performance. This information will be used to determine how the rumen microbes may be altered to improve feed efficiency. For example, it may be possible to provide the mother with dietary supplements during later pregnancy or provide the calf with a dietary treatment shortly after birth toincrease favorable microbes in the calf. This project will generate novel information about the impact of microbes in the rumen on calf performance, and how those microbes may be influenced to improve feed efficiency of beef cattle.","Our overall hypothesis is that variation in the rumen microbiome is associated with variation in feed efficiency. Our project-specific hypothesis is that the rumen microbiome is established at or near birth and is subject to maternal influences that can impact long-term feed efficiency of beef cattle. Specifically, we aim todetermine the relative contributions of the 1) genotype (i.e. genetic background), 2) perinatal maternal environment, and 3) postnatal maternal environment on the progeny rumen microbiome and feed efficiency of beef calves. Our long-term goal is to improve beef cattle feed efficiency. To accomplish this, we need to determine the relative contributions of these influences. Those relative contributions will establish whether we concentrate on 1) improving the genetic merit of the animal, 2) using the dam&#39;s influence to improve efficiency through a maternal effect (e.g., exploit breed complementarity with crossbreeding), or 3) modifying a postnatal environmental effect to enhance favorable microbial populations (e.g., seed the rumen at birth).","beef cattle, feed efficiency, microbiome, progeny, rumen"

With global demands for meat and milk expected to double by 2050, lowering methane production in cattle is critical for sustainable agriculture in the future.

The release of AMR genes and organisms, specifically antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and microbes, into the environment from agricultural sources is considered a serious threat, but little is known about their persistence and spread in the environment. Current risk assessment models cannot adequately characterize and quantify the proliferation of antibiotic resistance, especially in non-clinical settings. Reliable measurement and surveillance of antibiotic resistance is a complex problem that requires innovative solutions. This resesearch develops novel technology that will generate quantitative data on antibiotic-resistance genes in environmental samples. The advantages of this approach over existing technologies are that it does not require the cultivability of environmental bacteria; hundreds of resistance genes can be detected simultaneously; and hundreds of samples can be tested simultaneously. Applying this technology to environmental samples will determine points of maximum resistance gene diversity, thereby identifying the most efficacious mitigation points along the food chain. The development of this transformative approach that we are calling DARTE-QM (Diversity of Antibiotic Resistance genes and Transfer Elements-Quantitative Monitoring) integrates high throughput DNA sequencing technologies and an open-access data analysis pipeline that can identify the microrganisms in environmental samples that are contributing to antibiotic resistance gene prevalance. Our long-term vision is that we develop a technological platform that can be used to target ARGs for any environmental study and is scalable, accessible, and affordable to include in every microbial monitoring program.","The proposed research will provide a novel systems-based approach to characterize and quantify the presence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in the environment.

The virus is transmitted by biting midges in the genus, Culicoides. Although BTV was previously believed to be restricted to warm, tropical climates, it has expanded northward within the last decade, causing widespread and devastating outbreaks in Europe in 2006-2008. In the United States, BTV is absent from northern cattle producing states, where the primary North American vector, Culicoides sonorensis, is not found. However, there is concern that both vector and virus could spread north. To understand the risk of transmission, especially as northern temperatures become more suitable for tropical insects, many scientists have used mathematical models to calculate the potential range of vector species. However, these models only include data on the temperature tolerances of the adult stages.Because C. sonorensis spends most of its lifespan in one of three, relatively immobile immature stages (egg, larva, pupa), the environmental tolerances of these stages are more likely to determine the species&#39; range than those of the adults. In this study, we will define the limits of immature C. sonorensis survival at low temperatures by exposing them to subzero temperatures and calculating both their survival and the temperature at which they actually freeze. We will quantify the amount of glycerol, a cryoprotect chemical produced by many insects at low temperatures, produced by each immatures stage. Taking all this data together will help us understand which stage is primarily involved in overwintering. Additionally, we will also compare how low temperaturelimits and glycerol production differ between subtropical C. sonorensis populations (from southern California) and from populations near the known northeastern limit of the species (from the front range of Colorado), which may have different overwintering strategies suited to their climates. Ultimately, this data can be used to develop more accurate species range and expansion models. These models allow scientists to predict where and under what circumstances, BTV may appear in the future. Policy makers and animal health officials can then use this information to prepare livestock producers in these areas for the potential of transmission by initiating vaccination and vector control efforts.","To understand and quantifythe limits of low temperature tolerance of two distinct populations of the primary North American bluetongue virus (BTV) vector,Culicoides sonorensisCollectC. sonorensisfrom field sites in Colorado&#39;s Front Range (near Fort Collins, CO).Define the supercooling point (SCP; temperature at which water in tissues spontaneously freezes)ofC. sonorensiseggs, L4 larvae, and pupae from California and Colorado under ambient (27&deg;C) and low temperature (4&deg;C) conditions.

Physical characteristics used to assess welfare can include many different aspects of poultry. Footpad dermatitis (FPD or pododermatitis) is a necrotic condition that occurs on the bottom surface of the foot of poultry. Lesion prevalence, size and depth vary among poultry type. Lesions may be of such severity to be painful and so are considered a welfare issue in poultry production. Footpad dermatitis may also influence leg weakness development, another welfare indicator. Scoring systems exist for assessment of FPD but generally have not been linked to physical changes. The causes of FPD are numerous, however the interaction between the footpad of the bird with litter condition or characteristics appears to be key. The lesion in turkeys as compared to broiler chickens is of higher incidence and the time period of rearing to market for turkeys is so much longer than boiler chickens, so a greater potential exists for development of FPD and leg weakness in turkeys. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of development of lesions in order to lead to more effective mitigation strategies.The proposed research will first use a survey approach to determine if differences in FPD incidence and severity exist among different turkey sites and can be correlated to existing litter condition and characteristics. The assessments of FPD and gait score will use various published methods. Samples of litter will be collected and analyzed. Samples of tissue, bone and intestinal contents will be collected from euthanized birds with different scores of FPD and examined for differences in foot pad pathology, leg weakness, immune response indicators and bacterial composition. Walking characteristics of the turkeys will be measured with a gait pad. The second approach utilizes a controlled research study to change litter characteristics by changing stocking density and bedding material in the rearing of turkey hens. Similar measurements will be taken as in the survey approach. Relationships between the assessments and measurements will be determined for level of correlation. The overall goal of the project is to improve assessment methods for FPD and to identify factors in the development of foot pad that can be modified to mitigate the incidence and severity of FPD. The expected impacts of the research would be beneficial to the turkey industry - producers and processors; and consumers.","The overall research goal is to improve well-being of the commercial market turkey through better assessment of foot pad dermatitis (FPD) and an understanding of the factors contributing to foot pad dermatitis and its potential relationship to skeletal condition.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,1008242,2016-67015-24735,Increased pork production efficiency through enhanced lactation,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Hovey, RU, CH.",ACTIVE,"?The inability of a sow to produce sufficient milk to nurse and raise her piglets can negatively impact the economics of pork production as well as animal health and wellbeing. At the same time, improving the efficiency by which sows produce milk relative to the amount of feed they consume stands to yield positive financial and environmental benefits. One pathway directing these processes is the pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL) that acts via PRL receptors (PRLR) on cells in target tissues, including the mammary gland, during lactation.Our overarching hypothesis is that increased levels of PRL during the period between pregnancy and lactation will improve the milk production by sows and the performance of their piglets, and that these responses are due to changes in PRLR gene expression in target tissues.To test this hypothesis we propose the following generalized aims:AIM 1: Establish the effects of increased circulating prolactin on lactation and offspring performance.AIM 2. Define how the PRLR function in supporting target tissues of pregnant and lactating pigs.From these experiments we anticipate demonstrating that different compounds can increase PRL in pigs, leading to increased milk production, and that this increase in milk production will improve piglet growth before market. We also anticipate that the amount of the PRLR in different tissues and the ways it is working will be altered following these treatments.The impact of this work will be the development of new approaches that can be used by producers to improve the lactation of their sows and the efficiency that they can raise pigs to market weight. The knowledge gained from these studies will also fill a critical gap regarding how PRL works across different tissues, which also has implications for how reproductive performance, heat stress and immune function are managed in pigs.","The overall objective of our work is to develop strategies for increasing circulatingPRL during pregnancyin sows to an implementable strategy for improving sow lactation and piglet growth. In parallel our additional objective is tofurtherresolvethe molecular mechanisms by which PRL acts via the PRLR across the whole organism.Our first goal is to establishthe phenotypic consequences of late gestational hyperprolactinemia on lactation and offspring performance while evaluating a strategy for translating this intervention to production systems. In particular, we will firstestablish whether late-gestational exposure to the drug metoclopramide (MET)increases milk production and piglet growth comparable to that induced by another drug, domperidone (DOM). We willthen monitor parameters of post-weaning growth and performance, carcass composition, and behavior of progeny weaned by DOM or MET dams relative to those weaned by control dams. In this aim we will finallydetermine whether the effects of pregestational DOM and MET on the first lactation are preserved into a second lactation.Our second goalis to define the transcriptional regulation and mechanisms of PRLR function in supporting target tissues of gestating and lactating pigs. We will firstresolve the factors that regulate PRLR expression in supporting PRL-responsive tissues during late gestation and lactation. We will thenuse comparative genomics and targeted promoter analysis to define the transcriptional factors that direct PRLR expression in kidneys, small intestine and heart. Finally, we willdefine the downstream consequences of prolactin action on these unique targets.","lactation, mammmary, pig prolactin"

Relatively few studies have examined whether fruit chemistry in either wild or domestic plants can function as a defense against fruit-feeding insect pests.Fruit defenses against insects may include direct defenses, such as toxins in fruit pulp that deter insect ovipoisition and feeding, or indirect defenses, such as volatile compounds released by fruits that attract the predators and parasites of insect herbivores. Apples produce a diversity of both volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites that could function in defense, but their effects on herbivores and natural enemies are almost entirely unexplored. Furthermore, nothing is known about how apple chemical defenses may have been altered during domestication. The proposed research will use chemical analyses, experiments with insects, and field surveys to examine how apple fruitchemistry mediates resistance to fruit-feeding insects. The specific objectives are to: 1) Characterize fruit volatile and phenolic profiles and their relationship to herbivore resistance across 50 wild and 50 domestic apple genotypes; 2) Examine how apple domestication and breeding focused on increased fruit size might influence fruit defense; and 3) Determine whether direct or indirect fruit chemical defenses can be induced to decrease subsequent herbivore damage. Given that insecticides cost US farmers over $4.3 billion annually, understanding and harnessing natural fruit defenses could be a promising tool to increase the economic and environmental sustainability of apple production. The project fits well with the NIFA Priority Area 1 (plant health and production and plant products), and in particular with Sub-priority 4 (plant-pest interactions).","Research GoalsCharacterize variation in fruit chemical defense and its relationship to herbivore resistance in wild and domesticated apples I will combine field surveys, laboratory bioassays with focal insect herbivores, and analyses of fruit secondary metabolites across 50 wild genotypes and 50 domesticated varieties to examine how fruit chemistry shapes resistance to insect herbivores. Examine how apple domestication and breeding have affected fruit defense. I will use the chemical and ecological datasets generated for Objective 1, combined with existing genetic data, to conduct phylogenetically-controlled analyses that examine how domestication and selection for increased fruit size have affected fruit defense.Test whether apple chemical defenses are induced in response to herbivore damage. I will conduct experiments with four domestic apple varieties to test whether damage from fruit herbivores causes changes in: a) fruit secondary metabolites b) resistance to subsequent damage in the field, c) the preference and performance of focal insect herbivoresTraining/Career Development GoalsDevelop theoretical background and practical skills in agricultural ecology. The proposed research departs from my doctoral work in that it focuses on a domesticated species in an agricultural ecosystem. Thus, my primary training objectives are to: a) increase my theoretical understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes operate in an agricultural context, and b) develop a practical skill-set in agricultural research methods.Develop productive collaborations across disciplines.I will interact regularly with the Cornell Chemical Ecology Group, a consortium of 22 faculty from eight departments. I will meet diverse researchers within and outside Cornell at several national meetings and through weekly seminar series in Entomology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Plant Biology. At NYSAES, I will interact with the large group of researchers working on apples as well as stake-holders in the apple industry.Gain experience and develop proficiency in teaching and mentoring. Over the course of the Fellowship, I will hone my skills as an educator by serving as a guest instructor for short modules (2-3 lectures or activities) in existing courses taught by Dr. Poveda and other Cornell faculty.In addition to classroom teaching, I willdirectly mentor undergraduate students as research assistants (4-6 students per year) and for independent projects (1-2 students). Finally, I will take advantage of the enormous resources provided by the Cornell Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE), such as monthly workshops, consultations, and classroom observations.

These interactions have been shown to be important for influencing the abundance and distributions of herbivorous organisms (Fritz and Simms 1992), and therefore may play an important role in the biological control of invasive plants by herbivorous natural enemies. For example, it is known that the probability of establishment of candidate biological control agents is influenced by the genetic backgrounds of the target pests and the environmental conditions of the region targeted for control (Smith et al. 2010) in addition to competition, predation and/or parasitism (reviewed in Tipping et al. 2014). Understanding the relative importance of each of these component variables, as well as their interactions, may be particularly important for studying factors influencing the sustainability of invasive weed biological control programs as these programs have long relied on the co-evolutionary histories and interactions of candidate agents and target pests to provide weed control services (Manrique et al. 2008).","1.

PHS results in reduced yield and degrades the end-use quality of cereal grains. Dormant grain cannot germinate at maturity until it is exposed to a dormancy breaking condition such as after-ripening during a period of dry storage or soaking in water in the cold. PHS susceptibility results from insufficient grain dormancy at maturity to prevent germination. Wheat grain dormancy is associated with red kernel coat color and with higher sensitivity to the dormancy-promoting hormone abscisic acid (ABA). In addition to causing economic losses, persistent PHS problems have limited the geographic area farming white wheat. Hard (for bread) and soft (for cakes and cookies) white wheat are desirable because whole white flour has longer shelf life, is easier to mill, and has a less bitter taste in high fiber whole grain products. A two-pronged approach will be used to improve white wheat PHS tolerance: 1) PHS tolerance from white ABA hypersensitive wheat will be mapped and deployed into soft and hard white wheat winter wheat, and 2) genome-wide association mapping and a genomic selection model will be used to identify and more effectively breed for PHS tolerance in existing northwest white wheat breeding programs. The genomic selection model will seek to balance the needs for preharvest sprouting tolerance with the need for good seedling emergence within the breeding programs.","The primary goal of this project is to improve breeding for white wheat cultivars with pre-harvest sprout tolerance by introducing ABA hypersensitive mutants as a new source of tolerance, and by manipulating the existing PHS tolerance in adapted soft white wheat cultivars using a genomic selection model. To accomplish this, we will firstidentify induced SNPs linked to ABA hypersensitive mutations in wheat backcross populations through use of bulked segregant analysis of RNA sequence data. Secondly, we will use QTL analysis to map the locus providing ABA hypersensitive grain germination and PHS tolerance in soft white wheat ZakERA8 and introgress ERA8 into soft and hard white wheat breeding lines. Finally, we will perform genome-wide association mapping studies of traits that regulate preharvest sprouting tolerance in white wheat germplasm. This will then allow us to develop genomic selection models which can be used in breeding programs to increase the levels of PHS tolerance in white wheat without compromising agronomic performance. A combination of SNP markers, linked markers to QTL, and genomic selection will allow for efficient and effective selection of white wheat breeding lines for PHS tolerances that can then be validated under field conditions and released as new varieties to growers, thereby mitigating risk of PHS in commercial production situations.","Falling Number, aba, dormancy, gwas, preharvest sprouting, wheat, emergence BSA-RNAseq"

Trees in these woodland ecosystems occur near their functional limits with respect to water availability and may be strongly affected by climate change. Previous modelling studies quantifying how changing climate may affect semi-arid tree population dynamics have been limited by a lack of empirical data on the effects of climate variability on tree reproductive outputs, particularly among mast seeding species (i.e. species with highly synchronous and intermittent production of large seed crops). The research component of this proposed project examines how climate variability influences seed production dynamics of singleleaf pinyon pine, a dominant and widespread mast-seeding conifer of the Great Basin. This project also assesses the sensitivity of pinyon pine populations to changes in the magnitude and timing of seed production under different climate change scenarios. Understanding the resilience of pinyon pine populations to changing climate is important due to the multiple ecosystem services and ecological benefits this species provides. Regeneration failure of this foundation species would impact wildlife populations that depend upon woodland habitat and pinyon seeds as a food source, and would dramatically alter water and energy fluxes and carbon stocks. The highly nutritious pine seeds are also gathered by commercial and non-commercial pine nut harvesters, including Native American tribes, for both economic and cultural purposes. The education component of this proposed project will increase the science literacy of high school science students by training science teachers on innovative teaching methodologies and developing instructional materials. Development of a case study teaching module will be based on research results and used to educate students about plant reproduction and the potential impacts of climate change. Working in close collaboration with the school district, this project will provide K-12 educators with specialized training and packaged teaching modules to be directly integrated into their teaching as part of existing core curricula.","This project aims to increase our understanding of how changing climate may affect seed production dynamics of mast-seeding conifers in arid and semi-arid landscapes and to increase the science literacy of high school science students.The specific research objectives of this project are to: R1.)

These structures create unique growing environments that present new challenges to insect pest and disease management. Thus, developing sustainable, low-input and organic methods for growers is a critical knowledge gap that is increasingly important on diversified farms.One of the most pressing problems in cucurbit production, both in high tunnel and open-field, is damage caused by cucumber beetles and the bacterial pathogen, Erwinia tracheiphila, transmitted by this beetle complex. Many organic growers throughout the U.S. rate this as the most devastating and difficult to manage pest. Extending the cucurbit growing season in high tunnels increases the importance of understanding secondary vectors and inoculum on the landscape, as the crop is susceptible for much longer periods compared to open-field production. However, virtually nothing is known about the beetle complex--consisting of at least four species differing widely in their phenology and behavior--including their role in the epidemiology of disease progression in high tunnels and how these vectors can be sustainably managed.Here I propose to fill in critical knowledge gaps on E. tracheiphila infection by monitoring beetle population dynamics and bacterial inoculum throughout the growing season to identify susceptible time points during production. In addition, I will examine the efficacy of two novel management strategies for high tunnel organic cucurbit production: fine mesh screening and grafting. These techniques will be evaluated to control cucumber beetles and bacterial infection, while taking into account corresponding effects on secondary pest outbreaks (e.g., aphids and mites) and changes in the growth environment (e.g., elevated temperature). The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals, extension publications, and demonstrated to growers via field days and farm tours at Purdue&#39;s research facility.","The long-term goal of this work is to develop sustainable management strategies for controlling the Diabrotica beetle complex and bacterial pathogen Erwinia tracheiphila, to improve high tunnel cucurbit production.

The problem of stalk lodging may be framed as a limitation in measurement capabilities: stalk strength must be measured accurately to enable breeders to develop stronger crop varieties. Previous measurement techniques are error-prone and unreliable. Recent research by Dr. Daniel Robertson suggests two approaches for accurately measuring stalk strength. These approaches are based on structural engineering expertise and mechanical measurement principles and theory. Consequently, proper development of these devices requires input from both plant scientist and biomechanical engineering experts. This project integrates biomechanical engineering expertise with crop science. The main outcome of the project will be development of two portable devices for nondestructively assessing stalk strength in the field. Once validated, these devices will be applied in selective breeding studies to improve stalk strength.This project is also designed to support the development of Dr. Robertson as an independent researcher. As part of this project Dr. Robertson will develop professional teaching competences by incorporating research findings into undergraduate engineering courses. He will be mentored by an academic biomechanical engineer as well as by an industry plant breeder. This will enable Dr. Robertson to conduct fundamental biomechanical research while addressing practical challenges faced by working agronomists.

Light damage is well-known to degrade food flavor and decrease consumer liking in a range of foodstuffs, often generating off-aroma compounds through degradation of proteins and lipids. Existing literature has investigated the chemosensory effects of light intensity, wavelength and duration of illumination on photooxidation - particularly for the fluorescent lighting common to retail locations, and often in combination with the initial properties of the food (ie protein/fat/vitamin/antioxidant content). These studies have led to recommendations for foodstuff storage to avoid quality loss. In recent years, LED display cases and overhead lighting have begun to replace conventional fluorescence lighting in retail markets, but little research exists to determine the potential of LED lights to damage foods, and whether knowledge derived from studies of fluorescent light and foodstuffs can be extrapolated to LEDs. My group has recently observed that LED and fluorescent light damage lead to off aromas that can be differentiated sensorially from those originating from fluorescence. The central hypothesis to this proposal is that photo-induced damage caused by modern LED lighting proceeds through a different pathways than for previously studied fluorescent lighting, resulting in altered off-aroma formation, thus necessitating different intervention strategies. We propose to investigate the conditions influencing LED light-induced degradation of foods in the modern marketplace, the mechanism responsible, and evaluate possible interventions, to safeguard food quality.Due to interest in energy and cost savings, retailers are increasingly replacing fluorescent bulbs with LED bulbs, but the consequences to food quality are not yet understood. The overarching goal of the study is to examine the effects of LED light damage on foods, and to assess available interventions to alleviate this damage. Our hypothesis is that photo-induced damage caused by modern LED lighting proceeds through a different pathways than for previously studied fluorescent lighting, resulting in altered off-aroma formation, thus necessitating different intervention strategies. Empirical recommendations for LED exposure limits will be developed using human sensory testing, color measurements, and nutrient analyses. Interpreting the mechanism responsible for differences will be accomplished through evaluating change in volatile profiles. Intervention strategies previously developed for fluorescent lights, including active packaging and antioxidant supplementation, will then be appraised. Finally, consumer testing will evaluate the efficacy of interventions on improving overall liking, and perceived food quality.","Objective 1: Characterization of the onset of damage from LED light: Time-intensity thresholds for the effects of fluorescent light have been determined for several foods, with consumers detecting differences in certain foods resulting from photo-oxidation after less than 2 hours of illumination. Modern point-of-sale locations are switching to LED light due to lower operational costs, but recommendations for exposure limits to avoid LED light-induced changes in flavor, color, or loss of photosensitive compounds (e.g. riboflavin, vitamin E) is still lacking.Hypothesis: Due to their inherent difference, a safe exposure time for food in LED lights exists but cannot be predicted from previous research on fluorescent lights.Objective 2: Diagnosis of the associated sensory and chemical products formed by LED light exposure, when compared to fluorescent: Understanding the differences between LED and fluorescent light damage to foods requires quantitative study in both sensory and chemical domains. We will assay soybean oil and skim milk samples following light exposure by sensory, volatile, and nutritional analyses, to rationalize changes induced by differing light sources.Hypothesis: Volatile production patterns differ among light treatments (LED vs. fluorescent), and can be correlated to sensory off-aromas in exposed samples.Objective 3: Intervention to determine conditions capable of preventing damage from LED illumination: In recent years, several advanced packaging materials have been demonstrated to protect in varying degrees from fluorescent light degradation. Likewise, antioxidant supplementation has proven somewhat effective in protecting against light damage in various foods. We will investigate the efficacy of active packaging, and antioxidant enrichment, in protecting both soybean oil and skim milk from LED light damage.Hypothesis: Optimal strategies for protecting food from LED photo-oxidation through the use of additives or active packaging will differ from optimal strategies previously developed for fluorescent light due to spectral differences between LED and fluorescent lighting.",Sensory; taste; olfaction; LED; light; damage; quality; fluid milk; dairy; soybean oil

The US is the world leader in soybean production, and maintaining and increasing soybean yield is important for the US economy. Soybeans face yield losses from a variety of different pathogen species. One species that causes yield losses to soybean is the destructive fungal pathogen Fusarium virguliforme responsible for sudden death syndrome (SDS). SDS is an emerging disease spreading throughout the soybean growing regions of both North and South Americas. Growing SDS resistant varieties is the best method for controlling the disease. Unfortunately, SDS resistance is partial. To find new means of protecting soybean from SDS, the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause SDS need to be investigated.This project proposes to do so by investigating a fungal polyamine oxidase gene (FvPO1) found to be upregulated during infection of soybean roots. Plant polyamine oxidases have been shown to be involved in the plant response to infection, but the involvement of the fungal polyamine oxidase has not. Possible involvement of fungal polyamine oxidases in plant-pathogen interactions has not yet been demonstrated. To understand the role of FvPO1 in the soybean-F. virguliforme interaction, knockout and complemented mutants have been created and will be characterized. Initial analyses of the fvpo1 mutants indicate possible role of the enzyme in host defense. Transgenic soybean lines carrying FvPO1 have been generated and will be studied to determine the possible effect of FvPO1 on host resistance mechanism.","The US is the world&#39;s leading producer of soybeans. Soybean faces many yield limiting factors, which are either biotic or abiotic. One yield limiting stress is the fungal pathogen Fusarium virguliforme.

The study showed that genes with oxido-reductase properties were highly upregulated in the fungus during infection. One such gene was a polyamine oxidase gene (FvPO1). To study the role of this gene, knockout mutants were created. The original hypothesis was that the fvpo1 mutants would have reduced virulence on soybean. When soybean leaves were inoculated there was increased infection with the fvpo1 mutants when compared with the wildtype spores.This project has three goals. The first two goals are involved in gaining an understanding of the role FvPO1 plays in the soybean: Fusarium virguliforme interaction. With the understanding of this interaction and the role of this enzyme there may be the possibility of manipulating this interaction and generate a new source of resistance in soybean against F. virguliforme and other pathogens. These goals are: (1) investigate the role of FvPO1 by studying knock-out mutants; and (2) determine the possible pathogenicity or defense roles of FvPO1 by studying transgenic plants expressing the gene. The third goal of this project is a professional development goal. The funding from this grant will provide the ability for me to work as an independent researcher, and prepare myself to become a successful scientist after graduation. The following objectives for each of the goals will be completed for this project:Goal one, investigate the role of FvPO1 by studying knock-out mutants:Phenotype the fvpo1 mutant in soybean root inoculationsLocalize FvPO1 enzyme during soybean infectionLocalize polyamines before and after infection with fvpo1 mutant spores and wild-type sporesInvestigate differences in hydrogen peroxide, callose formation and cell death in soybean tissues inoculated with wild-type spores and fvpo1 mutant sporesGoal two, determine the possible pathogenicity or defense roles of FvPO1 by studying transgenic plants expressing the FvPO1:Investigate the response of FvPO1 transgenic soybean plants to F. virguliformeInvestigate the response of FvPO1 transgenic plants to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Phytophthora sojaeInvestigate the response of FvPo1 transgenic plants to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycineaGoal three, professional development:Engage one semester as a teaching assistant for a biology course at Iowa State UniversityComplete the Preparing Future Faculty program at Iowa State UniversityPrepare manuscripts from the research and present the results at professional meetings","disease resistance, soybean, Sudden death syndrome, polyamine oxidase"
PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND,1008134,2016-67011-24629,"A Transcriptomic Approach to Identify Key Regulators of Fleshy Fruit Development in Fragaria vesca, a Diploid Strawberry",National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,79000.0,"Shahan, RA, MA.",ACTIVE," Fruit set, the earliest stage of a flower&#39;s transition into a fruit, is crucial for successful fruit crop production. The flower to fruit transformation relies firstly on successful pollination and subsequent production of a signal by the seed. Upon receiving such a signal, fruit initiation and enlargement occurs. To maximize the production of high quality fruit crops, we must first understand the molecular mechanisms that tell a flower to initiate a fruit. To understand this process, we are using strawberry fruit as a model. Strawberry is unique in that the seed-containing structure, the achene, is positioned externally on the fleshy portion of the fruit. This &#39;seeds on the outside&#39; configuration gives us a unique perspective to understand how signals from the seed can regulate the formation of a fleshy fruit. The proposed project aims to identify and characterize genes that are crucial for fertilization-induced fruit set. To do this, I am analyzing a dataset generated previously in our lab that profiles the levels of expression for all genes in the achene both before and after fertilization. I will identify key regulators of fruit set by using a published algorithm that can identify specific patterns of gene expression. Additionally, I am characterizing a novel role that a gene called Flowering Locus T plays in strawberry fruit development. I hypothesize that this gene may facilitate communication between the achene and the fleshy fruit, a function that has not been previously reported. To study its function, I am creating strawberry plants with both increased and decreased Flowering Locus T activity. If the resulting plants have abnormal fruit development, we will gain insight into the function of Flowering Locus T and the mechanisms of communication between the seed-containing achene and the fleshy strawberry fruit. By understanding the roles that key genes play in early fruit development, we can apply our knowledge to maximizing crop yields. Consistent yields will contribute to food security and affordable access to crops for all citizens.","Goals:Insight gained from this work will instigate novel approaches in inducing fertilization-independent fruit development and ensuring high fruit yield, even with increasing global temperatures that may affect pollen viability. Since fruit set is triggered by fertilization-induced positive signals in all angiosperms, the resulting knowledge will be applicable to both strawberry and other crops. Additionally, the PD will characterize the role of FvFT1, a homolog of the florigen, in F. vesca fleshy fruit development. Recent hypotheses suggest that FT may function as a novel plant hormone, but no research to date has addressed its function in fleshy fruit development.Further, the proposed participation in scientific conferences, networking opportunities, and collaborations will enhance the communication skills and development of research ideas, will foster mentoring relationships, and will engender cross-discipline skill sets valuable for both current and future research endeavors. Opportunities to convey scientific ideas to the general public support the fellow&#39;s development as an effective educator and future faculty member.Objectives:1) Identify genes expressed primarily in F. vesca embryo, ghost, and ovary wall2) Characterize the role of FvFT1 in F. vesca fleshy fruit development3) Investigate movement of the FvFT1 peptide in F. vesca fleshy fruit","fertilization, fragaria vesca, fruit development, strawberry, transcriptome, Flowering Locus T"

Nonpoint source nutrient pollution is considered to be the driving force behind accelerated eutrophication of surface waters, and Lake Mendota (Madison, WI) is no exception. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical process models hold great promise as both research and management tools for lake ecosystems. However, even though bacteria play a critical role in mediating water quality, few models parameterize them as discrete entities at the level of taxonomic or functional groups.This work proposes to use a decade-long time series of bacterial community composition data, along with environmental data and community metagenomes to construct a trait library for key freshwater bacterial lineages, which can be used to ""split the black box"" and mechanistically model the bacterial contribution to nutrient cycling in lakes. The trait profile of each tribe will reveal its contribution to nutrient cycling, and trade-offs between traits and environmental variables can be used to parameterize functional modules within ecosystem-scale predictive models. In addition, the proposed work targets a major knowledge gap in microbial ecology--ecological trait inference from (meta)genome sequences--and should serve as a model for other ecosystems facing similar challenges (such as soils).",This research aims to construct a trait library for uncultivated members of the freshwater Actinobacteria. The trait library will be used to organize Actinobacterial lineages into functional groups based on shared traits.

Sous vide processing, the low-temperature, long-time controlled cooking of vacuum packaged raw foods in a hot water bath, has been reported to preserve flavor, aroma, nutrients, and texture of a wide variety of foods compared to conventional cooking methods. In addition to their high quality, sous vide foods are ""minimally processed,"" which is considered desirable by many health-conscious consumers. However, the mild cooking process combined with vacuum packaging raises concerns about the potential growth of harmful bacteria. Administering high pressure to food products, aka ""High Pressure Processing (HPP),"" prior to sous vide cooking, can potentially increase the safety and refrigerated shelf life of sous vide ready products without the use of heat or food additives. This non-thermal process is already used commercially for a variety of food products, and because no heat is applied, it produces ""fresh-like"" foods with minimal damage to natural flavors, aromas, and nutrients. However, at very high pressures HPP can damage the texture of foods. Therefore, we propose to combine moderate HPP pressures together with sous vide processing to produce seafood products with superior nutritional, flavor, and textural characteristics. Although we are initially focusing on high value seafoods (lobster and scallops), the results should be applicable to numerous other food products.We will be conducting four studies designed to increase our understanding about the effects of HPP on various quality characteristics of refrigerated, and subsequently sous vide cooked foods. First, we will determine the best sous vide processing methods (time/temperature parameters) for lobster tails and sea scallops that result in safe and high quality products. Product quality will be based on consumer acceptability testing at University of Maine&#39;s Consumer Testing Center. Participants who enjoy consuming lobsters and scallops will be recruited to rate the acceptability of the products using a 9-point hedonic scale (1 = dislike intensely, 5 = neither like nor dislike, 9 = like intensely). In step two, we will evaluate the effects of HPP variables (pressure/time) on physical and chemical qualities of the products, before and after sous vide processing. In the third experiment, we will determine whether consumers can tell the difference between sous vide cooked seafood products that have undergone HPP and those that have not. In the final study, we will determine the effects of HPP on the physical, chemical, and microbial qualities of the raw and sous vide cooked products during refrigerated storage. The results of these four studies will provide important preliminary information about the potential to combine HPP and sous vide processing in the development of high quality seafood products. If successful, we would ultimately like to see these technologies applied in the production of a wide variety of nutritious and flavorful food products.","The overall goal of this project is to combine high pressure processing (HPP) and sous vide technologies to develop refrigeration-stable, convenient-to-use, safe, and high quality foods. Sous vide cooked foods exhibit superior textural and flavor attributes resulting from low temperature thermal processing and an oxygen free environment. Currently pre-packaged, sous vide ready products are not commercially available due to their short shelf-life. HPP offers the potential to increase refrigerated shelf-life and safety of sous vide ready products. Research is needed to understand and assess the effects of HPP on the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory qualities of refrigerated, and subsequently sous vide cooked foods. The successful combination of HPP, a commercially viable non-thermal processing method, with controlled low-temperature sous vide cooking, has the potential to contribute to increased availability of high quality, minimally processed foods for American consumers.This project has four objectives:1) Establish sous vide processing parameters for subsequent testing of high-value seafood products;2) Evaluate the effects of HPP variables (pressure/time) on quality attributes of sous vide ready and of subsequently sous vide cooked products;3) Determine whether consumers can differentiate between control and HPP processed, sous vide cooked products; and4) Determine the effects of HPP on the shelf-life of sous vide ready and of sous vide cooked products.

Most plant virology research thus far has concentrated on avirulent (incompatible) interactions using dicot host:virus systems. We have observed that a compatible host:virus interaction of Panicum mosaic virus (PMV) in Brachypodium during the early stages of infection results in outcomes that are in contrast with those in avirulent and known virulent interactions of dicots--in particular, the suppression of ROS levels/signaling. Because ROS is crucial for plant basal and acquired immunity, its suppression by PMV could enable systemic infection. We recently determined the gross alterations in the transcriptome and the metabolome of Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium, a C3 grass) infected with Panicum mosaic virus (PMV). Of particular interest is our finding that the levels of key defense hormones and expression of several transcription factors and stress signal transduction components are modulated during the progression of disease. From these data, we have established the research aims: 1) Characterize how modulation of ROS homeostasis promotes PMV virulence; 2) Identify PMV-encoded effectors that target ROS defenses; and, 3) Determine if diverse grass-infecting viruses suppress ROS defenses in C3 and C4 grasses. Extending the findings of our studies with PMV to other economically important virus infections is a logical extension of our long-term interest in deciphering the basis of systemic (virulent, compatible) disease in grasses. The outcomes of this research will advance our fundamental knowledge of grass antiviral defense mechanisms and reveal strategies used by viruses to cause disease. Such knowledge will enable designing field resistance strategies to mitigate crop losses caused by viruses and associated stresses in millets, cereals, and bioenergy grasses.","Major GoalsEven though grasses are the primary food, feed and bioenergy source, little is known about antiviral defenses or strategies employed by viruses to infect grasses. From our preliminary results, we found that levels of key defense hormones and expression of several transcription factors and stress signal transduction components were modulated during the progression of disease in grass:virus interactions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are crucial for plant basal and acquired immunity. We found that early in the infection, Panicum mosaic virus (PMV)-infected Brachypodium plants have suppressed levels of H2O2 and ROS signaling. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which PMV suppresses ROS-mediated defenses in Brachypodium is a conserved antiviral defense strategy in grasses. This research will advance our fundamental knowledge of grass antiviral defense mechanisms, as well as reveal strategies used by viruses to cause disease. Such knowledge will enable designing field resistance strategies to mitigate crop losses.Objectives:1. Characterize how modulation of ROS homeostasis promotes PMV virulence2.

Maize in particular is the most cultivated and productive crop worldwide, and work from many groups has shown that changes in developmental control genes have been important for yield increases. This proposal is about the mechanisms by which plants grow and develop, using pools of stem cells called meristems. These structures are maintained in balance by a feedback loop between the CLAVATA and WUSCHEL genes. The proposal will use genetic and genomic approaches to study a newly identified control gene, FASCIATED EAR3 (FEA3), which codes for a cell surface receptor protein. FEA3 and its predicted ligand are expressed in specific groups of cells in the growing plant, suggesting a fundamentally new pathway in growth regulation in plants.Expected outcomes of this proposal are a deeper understanding of signaling during plant growth, and identification of new variants that could be used to enhance inflorescence size and seed productivity, important traits for food, feed and biomass production. The objectives target the program area priority of the NIFA Growth and Development program by using molecular, biochemical, and cellular approaches to improve plant productivity through studies of plant growth and developmental processes. The genes studied in the proposal could be applied in conventional breeding or in biotechnology approaches to improve crop yields and improve sustainability of US agriculture.","This project will characterize a new plant developmental signaling pathway in maize. Previous work in our lab has identified a morphological mutant of maize called fasciated ear3, in which tassel and ear development is severely compromised. Both structures are enlarged, particularly at the growing tip, or meristem. We identified the underlying gene, and found that it encodes a trans-membrane receptor protein, similar to CLAVATA type receptors that function in stem cell signaling and maintenance. However, our preliminary data suggests that this new gene functions in a different pathway, and the proposed work will characterize this pathway, and understand its role in plant development. They project has three major goalsTo perform a detailed analysis of fea3 mutants, and mutants in its candidate receptor, called FCP1.To find proteins that interact with the FEA3 receptor, using proteomics, and candidate downstream factors, using gene expression profiling.To ask if FEA3 can improve maize seed yields.

Why are wild plants successful with no need for pesticides, whereas chemical protection of our crop plants forms an integrated part of contemporary agronomy? What kind of strategy is it that wild plants can use whereas crops can&#39;t? Surprisingly, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), plant-derived molecules that cause their aroma or odour play an important role in the natural resistance of plants. When stressed, plants synthesize and emit thousands of compounds into the atmosphere, and these compounds help to limit the infection by fungi or bacteria, serve as stimulants of the immune system of the emitting plants and even of its neighbours, and they can attract predatory insects to the plant which then act as natural biocontrol agents.Research over the last years has produced a tremendous amount of knowledge concerning the biosynthesis of these compounds, their chemical identity and their roles in isolated interactions between specific plants and specific insects or microorganisms. Unfortunately, most research efforts were focused on isolated phenomena that can be easily investigated as part of the normal activities within specific disciplines. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary activities, by contrast, were rare, which left us with many open questions. We know that plants respond to VOCs that are emitted from stressed neighbours, but how do plants perceive and interpret this information, evidently without having a nose? Plants use VOCs to attract beneficial insects and, under laboratory settings, this plant-controlled biocontrol strategy works perfectly, whereas attempts to apply this strategy in the agronomic context revealed none or minimum benefits. Why do lab settings used for the investigation of plant VOCs and their ecological effects routinely tend to fail when it comes to their application in agronomy? We argue that the research into plant VOCs requires major efforts in which researchers from different disciplines, from plant molecular biology to ecology, pharmacology and insect neuroscience, will have to team up in order to combine different approaches to solve the same research questions. The Gordon Conference ""Plant Volatiles"" 2016 aims at initiating the interdisciplinary communication that will be required to reach this goal. We invited numerous speakers from countries and disciplines that never were present at earlier conferences of this style and further colleagues who work on topics that usually are considered ""borderline"" with respect to classical research into plant VOCs. Brining together people who never met before and allowing ample discussion time during and between the sessions shall initiate fruitful communication and catalyze the formation of interdisciplinary and international research groups. Including an exceptionally high proportion of young scientists (from PhD students and postdocs to recently established assistant professors) and announcing our conference via the social online media that are used by this next generation of scientists will pave the way for future developments: the transformation of our field into an exciting, cutting-edge scientific activity that transcends disciplines and guides new applications via solid mechanistic understanding.","The goals of the Gordon Research Conference Plant Volatiles are to promote interdisciplinary research aimed at enhancing our understanding of mechanisms that underlie the incredible diversity of VOC-mediated interactions of plants with their environment and to enhance the awareness among scientists, representatives of the industry, decision takers and the general public of the central role that plant VOCs play in numerous biological processes as well as of their potential in an array of applications: from agronomy and technical applications to medicine and human well-being.Our objectives are- to enhance the diversity of attendees at the GRC Plant Volatiles 2016 with respect to discipline, country of origin and career stage in comparison to earlier conferences,- to bring researchers together for whom this conference will be the starting point for the formation of fruitful collaborations,- to encourage, facilitate and organise the publication of research articles, perspectives, opinion pieces and reviews that communicate the major outcomes of the conference,- to enhance the visibility of plant VOCs and of their functions and possible applications in media such as online social webs and the public press","biocontrol, essential oils, pest control, plant disease, volatile organic compounds"

The negative impact of heat stress on yield stability and agricultural production has been exacerbated in recent years, and what is predicted for the future from climate change models is even more alarming. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of crop response to heat stress is critical to sustain agricultural production. Little progress has been made in this area, however, primarily due to the challenge of having access to field-based heat stress conditions, the complexity of the crop genomes, and the inadequate integration of physiology and genetics research. Without dedicated effort in advancing research in heat stress response in crops, we are certainly ill-prepared for global warming and climate change, which have shown the impact of climatological extremes, including high temperature stress, on agriculture production.The overarching rationale of the proposed research is to fill a critical research gap in understanding the mechanisms of crop response to abiotic stress, specifically heat stress response in maize. The first objective is to quantify the natural variation in heat stress response across a diverse set of maize inbred lines and identify underlying mechanisms through integrating analysis at the gene-expression, biochemical, and whole-plant level. To achieve this goal, we plan to conduct genome-wide gene expression profiling through of a set of diverse maize accessions that have been identified from extensive field screening. The second objective is to identify the genes that contribute to the differential heat stress response through joint analysis of two populations. Two mapping populations will be developed through the doubled haploid process, and field-based phenotyping and subsequent genetic mapping will be conducted.This project is designed to obtain a much improved understanding of heat stress by integrating biochemical and whole-plant characterization with molecular mechanisms. Knowledge generated from this project is expected to facilitate further breeding research in not only maize, but also many other crops. The societal benefit of this project is its scientific contribution to the sustainable agriculture production under changing climates.","High temperature stress severely limits plant productivity and causes extensive economic loss to US agriculture.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI,1008564,2016-67013-24586,Dissecting the response to boron deficiency during maize reproductive development,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,455000.0,"McSteen, PA, C..",ACTIVE,"Like people, plants need minerals and vitamins in order to maintain health and optimal yield. With a population that is expected to approach 10 billion in the next 35 years, the necessity to develop high-yielding crops is paramount. Additionally, with the stresses being placed on the environment by global climate change, over-cropping, and stripping of nutrients from the soil, it is going to become increasingly important to understand how plants obtain and use nutrients, so that we can develop plants better equipped to grow on less-than desirable lands. We need to understand these aspects of plant nutrition, before we can begin to develop strategies to overcome nutrient deficiencies and optimize plant growth and yield.Some nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are required in large amounts, while others are only needed in very small doses, but if that requirement is not met, the result is disastrous for the plant. One of these nutrients required in very small doses is the element boron (B). Without any B at all, plants cannot live, but small amounts of B are sufficient for proper function. B deficiency limits yields, particularly in cereal crops, and B deficient soils are widespread in the US, and worldwide. Despite B being a nutrient essential for plant health, it is one of most poorly understood plant nutrients. It is known that B is important for plant cell stability and rigidity, but how this affects basic processes in the plant is unknown. For instance, it has been shown that spraying certain crops like wheat with B can increase yields, but the reasons why remain a mystery. These experiments highlight the potential for developing simple but effective methods to improve crop yield, especially since B is cheap and relatively abundant compared to other nutrients. However, excess B is toxic to plants so understanding when and how B is needed and how it functions in the plant is essential. Thus, further research on elucidating the basic roles of B in plant growth and development particularly in important crop species such as maize is key to implementing strategies to overcome nutrient deficiency.One of the best ways to figure out how a nutrient functions in a plant is to take away the nutrient and look at the effect on growth and development. In our previous work, we identified maize plants that were altered in their ability to take up B from the soil, distribute B throughout the plant, and had problems with growth and ear development. These plants essentially mimic the effect of growing normal maize plants in B deficient soils, which provides us with a useful tool we can use to study the effect of B deficiency. Using these inherently B-deficient plants, we can apply a variety of different methods, including genetics, molecular biology, microscopy, physiology and biochemistry to 1) determine the basic cellular processes that require B and 2) identify genes that are important in taking up, distributing, or utilizing B in plants. We have designed our experiments such that we are using complementary approaches to achieve the end goal of identifying functions for B and the genes involved in B function. On one hand, we are directly testing whether B affects specific cellular processes by looking at genes known to be involved in those processes in our B deficient mimic plants. On the other hand, we are also looking at the effect of B deficiency on all genes to identify patterns that will point to specific processes being affected. Ultimately, these two methods should converge onto common processes and genes, providing strong support for specific roles. Through these studies, the more immediate goal is to be able to provide farmers with better information as to the amount, timing and frequency of B applications to maximize yields. This type of information can be distributed through publications as well as more informal means, including social media, and can potentially impact local communities very quickly. Ultimately, our goal is to identify genes that can be used to develop maize plants that are modified for optimized growth under low B conditions, thus increasing potential yield in marginal soils.","This project focuses on yield in maize, a crop vital to the economy and agriculture of the US. Deficiency of the micronutrient boron, (B) causes a reduction in yield and B supplementation increases yield, yet the mechanism by which B affects yield is not known. B deficient soils are widespread across the eastern half of the US, and fertilizer application causes environmental pollution and could lead to B toxicity. Hence, development of plants that can tolerate nutrient deficiency is desirable for the sustainability of US agriculture. For any of these advances to be made, we need a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of plant responses to environmental stresses such as B deficiency. Hence, the goal of this project is to dissect the role of B in maize reproduction and yield.Our overall hypothesis is that B-limitation affects yield by regulating critical cellular processes in stem cell populations called meristems. The objective of this proposal is to use the tassel-less1 (tls1) mutant of maize, which is B deficient, as a tool to induce and rescue B deficiency and test hypotheses about the role of B in meristems. We propose to use a multi-disciplinary approach including development, cell wall biochemistry, hormone biology, histology, confocal microscopy, advanced SEM and TEM techniques, genetics and genomics to dissect the mechanism of plant response to B deficiency. Determining the mechanism of the response of maize meristems to B deficiency will provide the foundation to develop new technology to ameliorate the effects of B deficiency on yield in maize.Three specific objectives will be carried out:Objective 1: Characterization of the cellular and molecular effects of B deficiency in vegetative and reproductive meristems of maize.Objective 2: Characterization of the interaction between B, the cell wall and hormones in meristem development.Objective 3: Determine if overexpression of B transporters can increase yield in maize.","auxin, boron, cell wall, cytokinin, maize, meristem"

Since the commercialization of the first generation of Bt-crops in 1996, Bt-crops have been widely adopted and the acreage of Bt-crops worldwide has reached &gt;70 million hectares, providing both economic and environmental benefits. With the increasing scale and prolonged planting of Bt crops, development of insect resistance to Bt toxins is the foremost threat to the long-term future of Bt crops. To date cases of insect resistance to Bt toxins in the field or greenhouses have been reported in several insect pests. To delay the development of Bt-resistance in insect populations, the new generation Bt-crops are engineered to express multiple Bt toxins that do not show cross-resistance to each other. The Bt toxin Cry2Ab has become a major insecticidal toxin in the new generation of Bt-crops to complement Cry1A toxins (Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac). Cry2Ab is now used in both the Bt-cotton and Bt-maize varieties that are widely planted in the US. Recently, we have identified that the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) strains that developed resistance to Bt formulations in greenhouses already have a high frequency of individuals resistant to Bt-cotton plants with both Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, and have also identified that the resistance to the two Cry toxins (Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab) is conferred by two genetically independent mechanisms. Therefore, we propose this research project aiming to understand the molecular genetic mechanism for insect resistance to Bt toxin Cry2Ab selected in agricultural situations, to provide fundamental knowledge desirable for management of insect resistance to Bt in agriculture.","The soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has been widely used for biological control of insect pests.

However, development of resistance to Bt toxins in insect populations threatens the long-term future of Bt-crops, and cases of insect resistance to Bt toxins in the field or greenhouses have been reported in seven Lepidoptera species. At present, the major biotechnological strategy devised to delay the development of insect resistance to Bt crops is ""gene pyramiding"" (simultaneous expression of multiple toxins), which is widely adopted in the new generation of Bt-crops. The Bt toxin Cry2Ab has become a major insecticidal toxin in the new generation of Bt-crops, including both Bt-cotton and Bt-maize varieties, to complement Cry1A toxins. We have recently determined that strains of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, that developed resistance to Bt sprays in greenhouses had a high frequency of individuals already resistant to both Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab in the Bt cotton Bollgard II. We have also determined that the resistance to Cry2Ab in T. ni is conferred by a novel yet to be identified molecular mechanism genetically independent of the mechanism for the resistance to Cry1Ac. For management of Bt resistance in agriculture, it is critically important to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of insect resistance to Bt-crops selected in agricultural systems. Therefore, this project is designed to understand the molecular genetic basis of Cry2Ab-resistance in T. ni by reaching the following complementary research objectives: 1) to identify the alteration of midgut protein(s) associated with Cry2Ab resistance in T. ni, 2) to identify the midgut gene(s) coding for the altered protein(s) and gene mutations associated with the resistance to Cry2Ab, 3) to identify the differential expression of midgut protein genes and their association with the resistance, and 4) to analyze genetic variation of candidate resistance-associated gene(s) in field populations of T. ni.","bacillus thuringiensis, genome, proteomics, transcriptome, trichoplusia ni, Cry2Ac resistance"

PROJECT,"BOYCE THOMPSON INSTITUTE FOR PLANT RESEARCH, I",1008590,2016-67011-24683,Molecular mechanisms of luteovirid phloem tropism,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,79000.0,"Alexander, MA, M..",ACTIVE,"Viruses in the family Luteoviridae, collectively referred to as luteovirids, cause economically important diseases on crops worldwide, including yellow dwarf diseases of cereals, sugarcane yellow leaf disease, and many others. In nature, luteovirids are transmitted exclusively by aphids, which feed on the carbohydrate-rich vasculature (phloem) of plants. As viruses themselves cannot be targeted by chemical applications, growers are limited to the use of insecticides to control aphid vectors: a strategy which is environmentally unsustainable, and ineffective at preventing virus spread within a field. Unlike many plant pathogenic viruses, luteovirids only infect a very tiny population of plant cells, the cells where the aphid vectors feed. The restriction to these small number of cells is called tropism, and it is a strategy used by all viruses, even those that infect animals, for spread to a new host. Despite the importance of tropism for these and other viruses, the underlying regulatory molecules, proteins, and genes are unknown. We hypothesize that elucidating the mechanisms that control viral tropism will lead to the development of new control strategies and resistant plants, and blocking tropism may prevent aphids from spreading these viruses within a crop.","The major goal of this project is to discover the protein interactions that regulate plant tissue tropism and pathogenesis. Tissue tropism refers to the ability to productively infect only particular cell or tissue types, is a key property of pathogens that affects dissemination and disease development. Tropisms can inform control strategies. Viruses in the Luteoviridae (referred to hereafter as luteovirids) are plant-pathogenic viruses which cause economically important diseases in staple crops worldwide. Phloem tropism is a key feature of luteovirids and is hypothesized to facilitate transmission by sap-sucking aphids. The molecular mechanisms underlying luteovirid tissue specificity are largely unknown. Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), Turnip yellows virus (TuYV), and the RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV) (Poleroviruses in the Luteoviridae) are ideal to study phloem tropism. These three species infect diverse hosts (solanaceous species, Brassica and other species, and cereals, respectively), have different vectors, and have divergent sequences, yet exhibit conserved phloem tropism.Luteovirids move from cell to cell and through tissues in both aphids and plants as non-enveloped virions comprised of viral genomic RNA and two structural proteins: the coat protein (CP) and the readthrough protein (RTP). The RTP is translated via readthrough of a leaky stop codon at the 3&#39; end of the CP gene and also functions as a non-structural protein in its free, unincorporated form. Current literature implicates the C-terminal half of the readthrough domain (RTD) of the unincorporated form of the RTP in phloem tropism. Truncation of the C-RTD or RTD entire of PLRV allows the virus to move out of the phloem and infect mesophyll cells. However, definitive evidence for RTP involvement is available only for PLRV infecting Solanum saccharoides, and the host proteins involved are unknown. Poleroviruses also produce the P0 protein, which suppresses the host post-transcriptional silencing pathway (the primary host defense against viruses). The action of P0 has been proposed to contribute to phloem tropism of luteovirids by selective suppression of host defense; however, experimental evidence shows that P0 is not the only factor at play.While two viral proteins involved in phloem tropism have already been identified, the host players and underlying mechanisms are hereto unknown. I propose a molecular approach to discover which host components are involved in phloem tropism of luteovirids. In Objective 1, I will compare and contrast virus-host protein-protein interactions among PLRV, TuYV and RPV. I hypothesize that interactions involved in phloem tropism are likely to be broadly conserved. In Objective 2, I will test whether the virus-binding plant proteins are involved in phloem tropism or perhaps another aspect of infection.Objective 1: Identify virus-host protein-protein interactions. To identify virus-host protein interactions, I will use protein interaction reporter (PIR), a novel mass spec-compatible cross-linker. PIR permits high throughput protein interaction identification as well as the topological features of the protein interaction. The Cilia laboratory has recently applied PIR to the discovery of protein-protein interactions both within PLRV capsids and between PLRV and Nicotiana benthamiana. I propose to expand the PLRV analysis to include a natural host, Solanum tuberosum (potato), and additional pathosystems: Arabidopsis thaliana and TuYV, and Brachypodium distachyon and CYDV-RPV. Host-virus protein interactions will be compared across all three pathosystems to look for conserved interactions.Host protein homologs participating in interactions with all three viruses are strong candidates for involvement in phloem tropism: a hypothesis I will test in Objective 2. I also expect to discover host-virus interactions that are unique to each pathosystem, which may be involved in host specificity. Protein modeling and bioinformatics analyses will yield information on the 3D structural topologies involved in protein interactions, and the degree of conservation and effects of selection on these putative binding sites. This information will be useful for making predictions about host-virus co-evolution and possible mechanisms regulating phloem tropism. The data may inform strategies for development of virus resistance by alleviation of phloem tropism.Objective 2: Validation and characterization of targets. As new virus-interacting host proteins are identified, I will confirm and characterize their roles in virus infection. I have developed a workflow to rapidly screen virus-binding plant proteins for an involvement in phloem limitation using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS). In-depth phenotypic characterization will be performed on the more promising candidates, including viral cellular and sub-cellular localization, replication, and systemic movement. Depending on the gene of interest, it may also be interesting to look for effects on aphid transmission, photosynthesis, carbon partitioning, and phloem architecture.I expect to be able to experimentally validate the involvement of a subset of candidates identified in Objective 1 in phloem tropism. By assessing alterations in cellular and subcellular localization, symptom development, virus replication, and other relevant qualities, I also hope to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms by which these genes prevent virus escape from the phloem. Using data from Objective 1, it may be possible to identify the viral binding site in host proteins of interest. If this binding site is distinct from the enzymatic site, genome editing technology could be used to specifically mutate residues implicated in the interaction. This would allow separation of the host protein&#39;s native function from its function in phloem tropism, presenting a convenient avenue for development of resistant cultivars.","interdisciplinary, mass spectrometry, plant health, circulative virus, tissue tropism"

Determining the effects of stocking density on the well-being, of lactating dairy cows provides only a partial answer to the overall challenge of overstocking as it rarely occurs in isolation. Instead, overstocked dairy cows typically face further stressors from their environment that may interact with stocking density to intensify the negative consequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal encompasses two-parts. First, overstocking elicits behavioral and physiological adaptations from dairy cows that cause subclinical conditions to develop. Second, the cumulative effect of multiple stressors is greater than the additive effect of each presented in isolation. To test our hypothesis, we propose to determine the interaction of stocking density and 1) dietary peNDF content, 2) restricted feed availability, or 3) heat stress on the well-being of dairy cows. To evaluate our objectives, we will assess: 1) natural living using feeding, rumination, and lying behaviors, 2) biological functioning using feed intake, milk production and milk composition (Objectives 1 and 2) and rumen pH and microbial populations (Objective 1), and 3) health status using immune function and stress markers. Quantifying the cumulative effects of stocking density, dietary forage fiber content, feed availability, and heat stress is the next vital step for alleviating stress and improving the well-being of lactating dairy cows housed in free-stall barns. We expect to develop science-based recommendations related to overstocked free-stall facilities and train students to conduct empirical evaluations of dairy cow well-being.","The fundamental goal of this research is to establish the impact of stocking density presented with or without a secondary environmental stress on the well-being of lactating dairy cows using a mix of behavior, physiology, and production-based response variables. In order to address this, we have developed a project that contains three specific objectives. First, we will determine the effect of insufficient dietary fiber, overstocking, or the additive effect of both stressors presented together. Second, we determine the effect of limited feed availability, overstocking, and the additive effect of both stressors presented together. Lastly, we will determine the effect of heat stress, overstocking, or the additive effect of both stressors presented together.","behavior, dairy cow, stocking density, well-being"

Rice (Oryza sativa) yield would be enhanced if growers could plant two weeks earlier in the season to better utilize the spring rain and avoid the high nighttime temperatures of mid-summer, which decrease grain quality and yield. Our objective is to use two diverse and well-characterized rice collections, the USDA Rice Mini-Core (RMC) consisting of 203 accessions, and Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) composed of 420 accessions, to provide a better understanding of the basic genetic and cellular mechanisms responsible for tolerance to cold temperatures at germination and the seedling stage in rice. To accomplish this, we will (i) validate cold tolerance phenotypes of the RMC in field experiments; (ii) test hypotheses for mechanisms of rice cold tolerance by examining membrane damage, levels of antioxidants and enzymes, and photoperiod response to cold in the RMC, and by conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS); (iii) fine-map some of the previously identified 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for cold tolerance using two bi-parental mapping populations genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS); (iv) identify putative candidate genes associated with cold tolerance using SNP based linkage disequilibrium (LD) data, gene expression profiles, and public databases; and (v) validate selected candidate genes in transgenic plants with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and by overexpression approaches. This information will be the basis for gene discovery, and ultimately, will identify cold-associated DNA markers and rice germplasm with improved seedling vigor early in the growing season for use in variety improvement programs.

Slow productivity growthin agriculture with rapid increases in demand leads to higherprices which couldreduce global foodsecurity and cause more land to enter agricultural production with negative environmental impacts.U.S. agriculture plays a critical role in this grand challenge given the importance of U.S. agriculture in global food markets.Our project will examine the consequences for global food and environmental security from different trajectories in future U.S. agricultural productivity growth.These simulationsdepend criticallyon the long-run response of global supply to price changes. The main innovation of our project is to contribute new estimates of long-run global agricultural supply response using modern econometric methods that exploit changes in price incentives due to changes in government distortions. These price distortions have changed over time differently by country and by commodity. We also decompose the total supply response into three margins of adjustment: changes in input use, changes in area used for production, and changes owing to increases in productivity. Rather than using year-to-year fluctuations in prices--as in traditional supply analysis--we argue that trends in government distortions to incentives reflect persistent changes to prices. Agricultural producers are likely to respond differently to these persistent changes in prices than to year-to-year price fluctuations and our project will give new insights to how producers respond to these persistent price shocks. We will incorporate our supply elasticities into a global trade model to explore the consequences of different trajectories of U.S. productivity growth on key metrics of food and environmental security. Our results will give new knowledge about agricultural supply that is critical for the analysis of many different policies. Our results will also inform society regarding decisions about publicinvestment in agricultural productivity growth by better understandingthe consequences of alternative paths of productivity growth.","The overall goal of this project is to estimate global supply response to persistent price changes and use these long-run elasticities to model the future challenge facing U.S. agriculture given projected trends in fundamental drivers such as global population, incomes, and technology. We will achieve the overall goal by accomplishing the following three objectives.Objective 1: Quantify the magnitude of the response of global agricultural supply to persistent price shocks.We will estimate supply response to persistent price shocks by exploiting changes in government policies that distort agricultural incentives. We will collect a country-level dataset using publicly available data sources on the following key variables: agricultural production by commodity, indices of agricultural production, total factor productivity (TFP) growth, government distortions to incentives, input quantities, prices, research expenditures, and weather. Modern econometric methods will be used to estimate the supply response. We will estimate the supply response for an index of total agricultural production as well as commodity-specific supply responses.Objective 2: Improve our understanding of the sources of supply response through the intensive, extensive, and technological margins of adjustment.Objective (2) uses similar econometric methods as objective (1) except that we change the dependent variable in order to decompose the total supply response as follows: the intensive margin (i.e., changes in inputs other than land), the extensive margin (i.e., changes in land use), and the technological margin (i.e., changes in total factor productivity).Objective 3: To examine the role of productivity growth in U.S. agriculture for global food and environmental security given the substantial increase in demand over the coming decades from a growing population with rising incomes. To this end, our parameter estimates from objectives (1) and (2) will be incorporated into global trade models to simulate the consequences of different scenarios of U.S. trajectories of productivity growth on key metrics of food and environmental security under different assumption about changes in government price distortions across countries. We will also consider different scenarios of future growth--to 2050--in global population, incomes, and technology in other countries.","agricultural production, international trade, technological change"

Education is critical among the agricultural community because although climate change threatens agricultural sustainability, skepticism of anthropogenic climate change runs high. Reaching agricultural audiences can be challenging because worldview-driven biases can prevent agricultural professionals from engaging in adaptation or mitigation efforts. Providing worldview-compatible climate curricula to K-12 agricultural classrooms may be a key strategy. Agriculture teachers have considerable influence over future agricultural and natural resource professionals, and adolescents may be less susceptible to worldview-driven biases. This project will leverage robust agricultural education and natural resource programs at NCSU along with the AFRI-funded Southeastern Forests and Climate Change (SFCC) module to provide teachers with a worldview-neutral resource that integrates climate change topics into existing Agricultural Science curriculum. My goal is to build climate change knowledge and risk perception among future agricultural and natural resource professionals through education. Specifically, I will train high school agriculture teachers in the SFCC module (extension), engage natural resource and agricultural education undergraduates in a robust service-learning program delivering SFCC lessons and measuring impacts (education), and test if engagement with the SFCC module increases climate change knowledge and risk perception among all participants regardless of worldview (research). Through these activities, this project will make progress in ensuring agricultural and natural resources professionals are fully equipped to ensure the sustainability of agroecosystems in the face of a changing climate.","The overall project goal is to build climate change knowledge and risk perception among future agricultural and natural resource professionals through education.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,1008615,2016-67013-24617,PRR37/PPD1 promotes flowering in long day grasses and represses flowering in short day grasses,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Dubcovsky, JO.",ACTIVE,"Yields of staple crops need to increase by 60% to feed 9 billion people worldwide by 2050. This challenging goal is further complicated by growing competition for land, water and energy, as well as by the potential negative impacts of climate change on crop productivity. Therefore, continued and dedicated research efforts are essential to increase yields and to expand the range of locations and environments where these crops can be grown productively.One of the most critical factors underlying grain crop productivity is a precise timing of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. For example, in environments with hot summers, early-flowering photoperiod insensitive wheat varieties mature prior to the onset of damaging high temperatures and show significantly higher yields than photoperiod-sensitive later-flowering varieties (&gt;35% in Southern Europe). By contrast, photoperiod sensitive wheat varieties show yield advantages in milder climates, as their delayed flowering extends the period of vegetative growth providing more resources for biomass and grain production. Similarly, late-flowering forage and energy sorghums show increased biomass, whereas grain sorghums are selected for early flowering to ensure sufficient time for grain maturation while avoiding drought. This proposal is focused on improving our understanding of the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in the grass family to assist breeders in selecting better adapted crops with improved yield and wider production environments.A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production. In wheat and sorghum this adjustment is regulated mainly by the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), a gene that accounts for most natural variation in photoperiodic response in several economically important grass species. In spite of its central role, it is still not known how PRR37 promotes flowering in wheat but represses flowering in sorghum under long days. The first objective of this proposal is to determine the cause of the reverse activity of PRR37 in short-day (sorghum) and long-day (wheat) grasses using transgenic approaches to exchange critical photoperiod genes between the two species. The second objective is to understand the interactions between the different photoperiod genes. Populations segregating simultaneously for the different genes will be used to determine their interdependencies in the regulation of flowering genes and heading time. The final objective is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the differential activity of PRR37 in the regulation of its downstream targets by analyzing PRR37 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.A precise understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in wheat and sorghum can have a significant impact on the development of novel varieties better adapted to a wider range of environments. In addition, the understanding of the similarities and differences in photoperiod regulation of flowering time in crops as diverse as sorghum and wheat will also enable the translation of this knowledge to other economically-important crops, including both short day (e.g. rice) and long day species (e.g. barley).","A critical factor underlying crop productivity is a precise adjustment of the developmental transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages to optimize seed production.

Integrated pest management frequently employs trap crops that attract pests of main crops. Trap cropping have become a viable option in farming systems that favor organic farming and promote insect diversity and pest resistance management. The efficacy of trap crops can be enhanced by application of synthetic pheromones (i.e. attractive volatile chemicals) of pests and the use of pheromone traps or baits. However, methods to produce synthetic pheromones can be limited by yield and overall cost. This project explores an alternative strategy of using plants as sustainable factories of pheromones and augmenting the use of trap crops by engineering pheromone biosynthetic enzymes into preferred host plants of pests. The project uses harlequin bug as a model, which is a major pest of cole crops (Brassicaceae) in the US South and increasing in pest status as growers continue to replace their use of broad-spectrum insecticides.The project uses molecular, biochemical, and analytical techniques to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of the harlequin bug aggregation pheromone, murgantiol. The identified gene tools are then applied to genetically engineer pheromone production in plants by using model plant systems and a selected Brassica trap crop. The selection of the trap crop is supported by determining the attraction of harlequin bugs to preferred chemical cues of the host plant. In summary, the project represents a proof-of-concept study in the emerging field of developing plants as sustainable biosynthetic manufacturers of insect behavior-modifying chemicals. As a long term goal, pheromone producing trap crops may be used to develop area-wide pest management strategies of pests that include harlequin bug and other stink bugs such as the invasive brown marmorated stink bug or Southern green stink bug.","Identification and use of insect sex and aggregation pheromones is indispensable to integrated pest management.

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,1008646,2016-67014-24750,Comparative genomics of specialization: the genetic basis of interspecific variation in pine use in Neodiprion sawflies,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,468527.0,"Linnen, CA, RA.",ACTIVE,"The ultimate goal of our project is to understand how and why insects alter their preferences for different host plants. Because the origin of every new agricultural pest starts with a change in host plant preference (i.e., an insect species switches from avoiding an economically important plant to feeding on it), this knowledge is critical to managing existing pest species and making predictions about the emergence of new insect pests. To a large extent, an insect&#39;s willingness to feed on a new host plant is determined by its perception of and response to chemical compounds found in the plant. The ability to sense these compounds is determined by a set of genes that are expressed in chemical-sensing tissues such as antennae, mouthparts, and feet. Thus, to understand how new pests emerge, we must characterize these chemical-sensing genes and identify the types of genetic changes in them that cause insects to prefer or avoid particular host plants. To this end, we will characterize chemical-sensing genes in 19 closely related species in the insect genus Neodiprion (pine sawflies), several of which are important defoliating insects in the U.S. that reduce growth and increase mortality in valuable timber species.Pine sawflies are an excellent group in which to identify mechanisms responsible for changes in host use because they are experimentally tractable (i.e., we can raise them in a laboratory setting and conduct experiments) and we know a great deal about the host plant preferences of different species. While all 19 species feed exclusively on pines, species differ in the number and identity of pine species. To understand the genetic basis of this variable pine use, we will sequence and assemble genomes for all 19 species. Then, in each genome, we will characterize all of the chemical-sensing genes. Using these data, we will ask whether particular types of genetic changes (e.g., mutations that alter or disrupt sensory function) are predictably associated with changes in pine use (e.g., increased preference or avoidance of a particular pine species). These data have the potential to identify specific genes involved in pine use that could serve as targets for novel pest control strategies for pine-feeding insects. More generally, these data could reveal genetic characteristics that make some species more likely to become pests than other species. Finally, to fully leverage the power of this system for increasing our understanding of how changes in host use occur, we will make all of our data publically available. Together, this work will increase our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying changes in host use behavior.","The origin of every new agricultural pest starts with the acquisition of a new host, and an expanded host range relative to ancestral populations appears to be one of the key traits that predisposes particular insect lineages to give rise to new pests. While the ecological determinants of host use have long been studied, investigation into the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms is still in its infancy. With recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insect chemosensation and detoxification, we are beginning to connect variation in host-use traits to variation in specific genes and gene families. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to improve predictions regarding the emergence of new pests and to provide novel strategies for biologically based pest control. However, a key challenge is to isolate those aspects of host-use genetics that characterize multiple taxa from those that are highly idiosyncratic. One powerful approach for identifying these common mechanisms is the comparative analysis of candidate host-use genes among closely related species differing in host-use patterns.To date, Drosophila is the only insect group for which a comparative analysis of host-use genes has been carried out. Intriguingly, this work suggests that the genetic basis of host-plant specialization might be predictable. In particular, specialization on a novel host is associated with widespread loss of chemosensory genes and elevated rates of molecular evolution in remaining chemosensory genes. However, the extent to which these same patterns characterize other insect taxa remains to be seen. Thus, the main goal of the proposed work is to test the hypothesis that changes in host use involve predictable genetic changes. Specifically, we will combine chemosensory gene annotations and host-use data from an experimentally tractable and well-studied group of pine-feeding insect pests in the genus Neodiprion (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae). When analyzed within an explicit comparative framework, these data will allow us to determine the extent to which changes in host use involve predictable genome-wide changes and also the extent to which adaptation to the same host plant species involves the same genes.To these ends, we will complete four specific research objectives:Sequence, assemble, and annotate a high-coverage genome of Neodiprion pinetum.Sequence and assemble moderate-coverage genomes from a monophyletic and well-studied group of 19 eastern North American Neodiprion species.Annotate candidate chemosensory gene families in each genome.Use comparative methods to identify associations between chemosensory gene evolution and host-use evolution.","host preference, host range, chemosensory genes, genetic convergence, pine sawflies"

PROJECT,SAES - KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,1008356,2016-67013-24473,Empowering wheat breeding using the genomic signals of eco-geographic adaptation,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,301463.0,"Akhunov, ED, D.",ACTIVE,"Genetic improvement of crops remains one of the critical elements of strategies aimed at reducing the effect of climate change on crop production and doubling agricultural outputs by 2050. A crop&#39;s ability to adapt to changing environments depends on the availability of variants of genes increasing plant&#39;s resilience to climatic extremes. Owing to their broad geographic distribution, crops and their wild relatives are a rich model system for investigating the genetic mechanisms of local adaptation, providing a valuable source of new diversity, of which only a small fraction so far has been used for improving crops&#39; adaptive potential.An effective strategy for developing climate resilient varieties is to use variants of genes from the wild relatives of wheat. Previous studies showed wild relatives from stressed environments are a valuable source of new diversity for improving the drought and heat adaptive potential of wheat.With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies it has become possible to generate whole genome variation data for large geographically diverse populations of plants. These data combined with climatic data collected from the sites of sample collection were successfully used to identify variation in DNA sequence that helps plants to adapt to local environments. The main rationale behind these approaches referred to as genome-wide environmental scans (GWES), is that variation contributing to local adaptation can be identified based on an unusually high correlation between their frequencies in local populations and local climatic variables. Importantly, studies on a model plant species demonstrated that the presence of genetic variation correlating with climate in a specific plant line could serve as a good predictor of its performance in a specific environment. The proposed project will develop a strategy based on the NGS of wild goatgrass, one of the wild relatives of wheat, collected from regions along the environmental gradients to identify DNA sequence variation contributing to climatic adaptation. A genome-wide variation dataset will be tested for correlation with seasonal variation in temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, season lengths, and aridity.We will perform genetic crosses of wheat lines adapted to Kansas environment with multiple goatgrass accessions to develop populations that will carry the segments of wild chromosomes. These populations will be tested for the presence of genetic variation strongly associated with climatic variables, and will be planted at several locations across the state of Kansas showing significant seasonal differences in the amount of precipitation and temperature. Performance of wheat lines will be assessed by collecting phenotyping data reflecting their ability to cope with variation in temperature and water availability. These data will be used to test the utility of climate-associated variation to predict performance of wheat lines in Kansas environments. The information collected will be valuable for developing a new generation of genomic prediction models that will more effectively handle the uncertainty of phenotype predictions in diverse environments, and increase the overall effectiveness of crop breeding for targeted climatic conditions. The project efforts will also lead to the development of novel germplasm that will be used to support variety development and will be shared with the wheat breeding community. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to empower the US and international wheat breeding programs by establishing genomic and statistical tools that will leverage information about the genomic signals of eco-geographic adaptation to prioritize global genetic diversity in germplasm repositories for deployment in breeding programs.","Recent studies of the yield trends in major crops has shown that in 24-39% of global crop growing areas yields never improve or sometimes even decline. Most variation (&gt;60%) in yield in the major crop producing regions was explained by climatic variation in the amount of precipitation and temperature. Modeling showed that warming has already begun slowing yield gains in the majority of wheat growing regions, with production expected to fall by 6% for each degree of temperature increase. In the face of global environmental changes, and the reduction of arable land and available water, these trends are expected to worsen, and coupled with population growth, will increase pressure on agricultural production.A plant&#39;s ability to adapt to changing environments depends on the availability of alleles linked to the maximal expression of adaptive traits. Owing to their broad geographic distribution, wheat and its wild relatives provide a rich system for investigating the basis of adaptation, providing a valuable source of new allelic diversity, of which only a small fraction was used for improving wheat&#39;s adaptive potential. Prioritization of this allelic diversity for deployment in the breeding programs remains critical for increasing their effectiveness and improving their ability to assemble allelic complexes in high-yielding varieties resilient to future climates.With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) it has become possible to generate genome-wide variation data for large geographically diverse populations. These datasets combined with eco-geographic variables were successfully used to identify alleles associated with adaptive phenotypes. The main rationale behind these approaches referred to as genome-wide environmental scans (GWES), is that loci involved in local adaptation can be identified based on an unusually high correlation between allele frequencies and important eco-geographic variables. In some studies, loci associated with climate variation were shown can predict the relative fitness of plant accessions in a specific environment.Here, we propose to use the recently developed methods of genome-wide environmental scans to identify adaptive alleles based on their correlation with important climatic variables in the global populations of wheat and its wild relatives. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to empower the US and international wheat breeding programs by establishing genomic and statistical tools that will leverage information about the genomic signals of eco-geographic adaptation to prioritize global genetic diversity for deployment in breeding programs, and to predict the phenotypic performance from its genotype.Objective 1: Catalog genome-wide DNA sequence variation in wheat and its wild relatives. A cost-effective next-generation sequencing of population pools will be performed using the wheat exome capture assay in populations of Ae. tauschii selected from regions showing strong differences in the amount of precipitation and temperature. These datasets will be combined with previously generated data for geographically diverse lines of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat to construct high-density variation maps. The SNPs discovered in our study along with their adaptive values inferred based on environmental association analyses (Objective 2) and phenotypic data (Objective 3) will be deposited to the public T3 database (triticeaetoolbox.org) for advancing wheat genetic studies and informing breeding decisions.Objective 2: Identify adaptive alleles through the analysis of eco-geographic patterns of genomic variation. The distribution of genomic variation across diverse environmental gradients and geographic areas will be studied using the genome-wide environmental scans for seasonal variation in temperature, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity, season lengths, and aridity.Objective 3: Field-based phenotyping of drought and heat adaptive traits. Field testing of adaptive Ae. tauschii alleles will be performed at three locations using populations developed by backcrossing ""adapted cultivar""-Ae. tauschii amphiploids to parental lines, which are adapted to Kansas or Great Plains&#39; environemnts and show good yield potential, tolerance to drought or race nonspecific resistance to fungal pathogens. These adapted lines are crossed with geographically diverse accessions of Ae. tauschii to develop amphiploids. To assess plant&#39;s performance, physiological measurements including canopy temperature depression, NDVI, spectral reflectance, and chlorophyll content will be collected along with phenological data and yield-related traits.Objective 4: Prediction of phenotypic performance using climate-associated alleles. The ability of alleles correlating with seasonal variation in precipitation, temperature, and aridity to predict phenotypic performance in Kansas environmental conditions will be tested by comparing with field-based phenotyping data and the results of genomic predictions based on whole-genome variation data.","breeding, environmental adaptation, genomic prediction, wheat ecogeography, whole exome sequencing"

PROJECT,"AMERICAN CHESTNUT FOUNDATION INC, THE",1008426,2016-67013-24581,Identification of genes and alleles for blight resistance in Castanea spp,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,150000.0,"Georgi, LA.",ACTIVE,"To help finish cultivars being developed by an ongoing, public participatory breeding program of American chestnut, we will identify candidate genes for resistance to blight (incited by Cryphonectria parasitica) through genetic mapping of large, advance-generation, hybrid backcross populations using next-generation sequencing supported by a reference genome assembly. First, we will improve the reference genome assembly by obtaining long-read sequence data. Then we will obtain reduced-representation sequences of the hybrid trees and align these sequences to the improved reference genome assembly to obtain genotypic data. The genotypic data, together with metrics derived from phenotypic data measuring the blight resistance segregating in the hybrid populations, will be used to build Genomic Selection (GS) models to predict blight resistance as well as to perform a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic architecture of blight resistance and, if possible to identify the genes and alleles involved. The results will be immediately translated into practical applications, using the GS models to predict blight resistance and developing cost-effective markers for alleles of the most effective resistance genes to assist selection of trees in the breeding program. Marker technology is badly needed as thousands of B3-F2 plants are produced each year and each needs to be evaluated for blight resistance. Accurate marker prediction will greatly improve the efficiency of this resources-intensive step. This project is a critical next step in the more than half-century-long effort to develop disease resistance in American chestnut in order to restore it to its historic place in the heart of the Appalachian Mountain ecology and economy. This project will specifically address the first and second foci of program priority area A1141 (Plant Breeding for Agricultural Production,) -- namely, ""Pre-breeding and germplasm enhancement, cultivar development, selection theory, applied quantitative genetics, and participatory breeding;"" and ""development and application of tools to predict phenotype from genotype to accelerate breeding of finished varieties.""","The long-term goal of this proposed research is to contribute to enabling the American chestnut to resume evolving on its own (a basic tenet of conservation), which, due to insufficient reproduction, has not been the case since the original blight pandemic. While not a specific goal of our project, successful restoration also would provide the benefits of increasing timber production in Appalachian forests and markedly increasing food production in them, in the form of chestnuts for direct human consumption plus in the form of domesticated and undomesticated animals that feed on chestnuts. The principle avenue being pursued by The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) to effect restoration is to introgress chestnut blight resistance (Cbr) genes from Chinese to American chestnut using a modification of the backcross method of plant breeding. A potential bottleneck in this method is selection of B3-F2 progeny true breeding for blight resistance. Currently, progeny testing is used to make final selections within B3-F2 families. The high volumes of trees required for this progeny testing may overwhelm the capacity of TACF&#39;s network of state chapters staffed by volunteers, who are key participants in this breeding program. We propose to address this potential bottleneck by developing suitable, higher throughput methods of marker-assisted selection. We intend to pursue a two-pronged approach in this endeavor: 1) to develop a Genomic Selection (GS) model for predicting levels of resistance to blight in B3-F2 progeny derived from the &#39;Graves source of blight resistance; and 2) to identify the specific genes and alleles responsible for blight resistance.The immediate goal of the proposed research is to identify genes and alleles for blight resistance in chestnut. Successful identification will permit marker-assisted selection for blight resistance to be substituted, in part, for progeny testing to select B3-F2s true breeding for blight resistance, eliminating a key bottleneck, and will contribute to an understanding of the interaction of resistance and pathogenicity genes that is critical to developing effective and sustainable host resistance.Our proposed research project will specifically address the first program priority area (Plant Health and Production and Plant Products; Plant Breeding for Agricultural Production, A1141)--namely we will identify, sequence and isolate disease resistance genes in Chinese chestnut for the purpose of enhancing American chestnut germplasm (i.e., developing open pollinated cultivars for forest planting) using an already implemented participatory breeding program. The goal is to develop tools to predict phenotype from genotype, to accelerate development of seed orchards that produce bulked synthetic varieties. The breeder of these varieties, which have been developed to date using traditional methods, for the most part, is Dr. Hebard, who is a co-PD on the project. Disease resistance is the limiting factor in developing American chestnut germplasm for planting in large-scale forest restoration projects. Our project specifically addresses this limitation by using state-of-the-art high-density genome-wide genotyping of 1200 B3-F2 trees segregating for chestnut blight resistance. While evidence from an F2 mapping population points to three major QTL for blight resistance, the associated genomic intervals are wide, encompassing many hundreds of genes, and the study did not have the resolution or power to identify linked or smaller-effect resistance loci. Incorporating marker information into our advanced backcross breeding programs, in which linkage disequilibrium is an order of magnitude or more lower, therefore necessitates the much greater resolution afforded by a GBS/GS approach. However, we will apply GWAS to the data as well, to investigate the genetic architecture of blight resistance. Should blight resistance be conditioned by a small number of loci of large effect, identification of the genes and alleles responsible would provide selectable markers that can be used with confidence at any generation of breeding, without concern about the continued accuracy of GS model predictions as breeding progresses or for progenies that are for other reasons less closely related to the training population but still carry the same genes and alleles for blight resistance. The greater resolution of the Cbr regions afforded by the present study should provide the necessary genomic detail to determine accurately the underlying candidate resistance genes and their control elements, especially given the power of comparative genomics and the availability of genomes of peach, poplar and other plants, combined with the possibility of unraveling the molecular interactions between host and parasite available from identifying factors associated with resistance the host. Having high-density markers and candidate genes will allow an efficient and powerful translation of the information for immediate use in molecular-assisted breeding. This technology is badly needed in the American chestnut breeding program as thousands of B3-F2 trees are produced each year that need to be progeny tested for blight resistance. Having this marker resource and gene information will allow more precise estimation of the B3-F2 resistance value with a minimum of field progeny tests in order to finalize selections in seedling seed orchards. Finally, the benefits of this technology will be nicely transferred to the many restoration partners through TACF&#39;s participatory breeding program.Restoring the American chestnut to its native range will greatly improve and help to sustain U.S. agricultural, natural resource and food systems. American chestnut is a cultural and economically iconic, ecological foundation species worthy of restoring to its historic range and status. Due to its substantial economic value (nutritious nuts for human, livestock and wildlife consumption, wood and fiber products, chemical feedstocks), it can help to revitalize and stabilize rural economies throughout the eastern U.S, but particularly in the Appalachian Mountain regions with otherwise unproductive soils. The American chestnut tree could play a small but vital part in staving off hunger. This project is novel in that it aims to enhance a forest tree with significant forestry, horticultural and agricultural value, using state-of-the art genomic science and technology in the context of a broad-based, participatory breeding program. These features will provide fully translated tools needed to achieve desired ecological and economic impacts in a format relevant to real world utilization.Objectives:1. Improve the Chinese chestnut reference genome assembly using long sequence reads; estimate within- and between-species variation by aligning existing low-pass sequence data from additional American and Chinese individuals to the reference; and generate a reference-supported assembly of an American chestnut genome.2. Generate genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data for a large set of B3-F2 chestnut trees, and use the genotypic data to develop genomic selection (GS) models to predict disease resistance as well as in genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) to identify candidate genes for resistance.","GBS, castanea, chestnut, chestnut blight, gwas, molecular genetics, ngs, qtl, Cryphonectria, GS"

Our broad, long-term objective is to discover and understand key physiological pathways regulating development and function of the uterus and conceptus (embryo/fetus and associated extraembryonic membranes) in order to provide fundamental information useful for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of fertility problems in domestic animals and humans. The receptive uterus represents a temporary, but unique physiological state when conceptus development and implantation is possible. Inadequate uterine receptivity and conceptus-maternal interactions negatively affects conceptus development, signaling for pregnancy recognition, implantation and establishment of pregnancy. Defects in those critical biological processes are considered primary causes of pregnancy loss and may be the origin of later pregnancy complications in both domestic animals and humans. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the idea that extracellular vesicles represent a new paradigm in uterine receptivity and conceptus-maternal interactions and have a biological role in pregnancy. Exosomes/microvesicles are nano-sized, cell-derived vesicles that mediate cell-cell communication by entering target cells and eliciting biological effects via gene regulation and alteration of cellular pathways impacting cell survival and growth. Our central hypothesis is that exosomes/microvesicles, emanating from the uterus and conceptus, are important functional mediators of uterine receptivity, conceptus-maternal interactions, and conceptus development and implantation. Specific aims are to: (1) understand exosomes/microvesicles in the uterus during early pregnancy; and (2) determine functional role of exosomes/microvesicles and uterine luminal fluid in conceptus development.

PROJECT,VET - COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY-SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,1008469,2016-67012-24679,Improving our understanding of the ecology of antimicrobial resistance in food production using Bayesian model and machine learning approach,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,80286.0,"Noyes, NO.",ACTIVE,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing public health concern with ramifications for food production, particularly meat and poultry. Our group has recently adopted a next-generation sequencing, metagenomics-based approach to researching AMR in livestock production. This sequencing technology allows us to access all of the bacterial DNA within a given sample, thus enabling investigation of the complex microbial ecosystem in which AMR exists. However, in order to extract meaningful patterns within such sequence data, advanced statistical methods must be applied. The goal of this proposal is to use advanced statistical methods such as hierarchical Bayesian modeling and machine learning to uncover patterns of association between livestock production strategies (such as antimicrobial use practices) and AMR. To this end, we will identify, optimize, validate and apply existing Bayesian and machine learning tools to three metagenomic datasets generated from studies of AMR in livestock production. Outcomes of these activities include provision of open-source statistical analysis methodologies for use by other agriculture scientists grappling with complex research data; as well as identification of important and actionable drivers of AMR in livestock production systems. These outcomes directly fulfill the program area of food safety by providing evidence-based results that can be used to formulate effective AMR mitigation interventions and policies.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical public health issue. Infections with resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional 8 million hospitalization days, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections alone caused 9,650 deaths in the US in 2011. Meat production systems are thought to contribute to the problem by harboring a reservoir of AMR that interfaces with humans either through persistence in the food chain or dissemination of wastes into the environment. Antimicrobial use in food producing animals is often cited as a driver of AMR in food production, but this blanket statement fails to recognize the extremely varied contexts in which such use occurs.Unfortunately, scientific research has been largely unable to provide consistent guidance as to which specific use practices require modification in order to protect public health. Our group has been researching antimicrobial use in food animals for over a decade. We have typically determined resistance status based on either the failure of indicator organisms to grow in antimicrobial-impregnated cultures, or on the presence of PCR-amplified fragments in sample DNA. Using these methods, we have conducted many large, well-designed prospective cohort studies of antimicrobial use and resistance in commercial settings. Despite the meticulous thought that went into these studies, we continue to grapple with anomalous and often contradictory results. One study involving feedlot cattle found weak positive associations between tetracycline exposures and resistance, while another showed increasing prevalence of tetracycline resistance in the absence of any tetracycline use. These are but a few examples from a large body of literature that can best be described as consistently inconsistent. Within this context, it is unsurprising that policy makers and producers alike are hard-pressed to formulate evidence-based policies for AMR mitigation.Given our experience in this area, we came to believe that culture- and PCR-based methods were inadequate for identifying and understanding use-resistance patterns that occur within a complex ecosystem. For example, cattle feces contain thousands of bacterial taxa. In this context, studies that generalize AMR findings gleaned from one or two indicator bacteria commit ecological fallacy. PCR-based methods may circumvent this problem, but typically focus on one or two antimicrobial drug classes, while many cross-class resistance determinants travel frequently and readily between distantly related bacteria. Given these shortcomings, we have adopted a shotgun metagenomics approach as a potential means of providing more consistent and actionable answers to the question of AMR in food production. Through two studies, we have identified over 350 unique AMR genes in cattle production systems, a degree of diversity that is impossible to identify using culture- and PCR-based approaches. We have found that different biomes - but not different cattle production systems - harbor distinct AMR profiles. Preliminary evidence also suggests that currently utilized harvest interventions not only reduce pathogen load, but may also serve to mitigate transmittance of AMR into retail beef. Further, our data show a decrease in AMR diversity throughout cattle production, perhaps indicating selective pressure on bacterial populations.These findings are immensely intriguing, yet barely scratch the surface of what we could find using more advanced statistical and computational methods. Unfortunately, these methods have only just begun to find their way into microbiome research, and have not been applied to metagenomics projects in agriculture. Specifically, there is an urgent need to apply advanced statistical and computational methods towards finding complex associations between metadata factors (such as management practices and antimicrobial use) and patterns of AMR in metagenomic sequence data - as well as an urgent need for people who can appropriately use these methods. The goal of this project is to understand drivers of AMR by uncovering complex patterns of interactions between multiple ecosystems operating at different levels - from the genes, to the bacteria, to the host, to the environment, and to the management practices utilized in food production. We propose to adapt existing Bayesian modeling and machine learning methods to achieve this goal. At this point, we have assembled all of the necessary ingredients to achieve this - metagenomic and related datasets, a validated bioninformatics pipeline, sufficient computational capacity, existing statistical methods, and individuals with expertise in how to apply them. Now begins the hard work of identifying the most appropriate and useful statistical methods for our data, and modifying them to the specific nature of metagenomic data and the specific question of AMR in food production. Therefore, the specific objectives are:Objective #1 - identify a set of tools that can be used to execute hierarchical Bayesian modeling and machine learning methods on metagenomic datasets.Objective #2 - test, optimize and validate the tools identified in Objective #1 using our own metagenomic datasets.Objective #3 - apply optimized tools to new and existing metagenomic data to uncover novel associations between genes, microbes, host, environment and management practices that influence AMR dynamics in food production systems.","bioinformatics, microbiome, statistics"

PROJECT,SAES - VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY,1007985,2016-67011-24703,Impact Of Pre-Weaning Nutrition On Endocrine Induction Of Mammary Development In Dairy Heifers,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,79000.0,"Geiger, AD.",ACTIVE,"The ProblemAbout one-third of the U.S. dairy herd valued at ($5.4B) is replaced yearly. These replacement animals come from the female calves born to lactating cows on these farms. It has become widely appreciated that nutrition and management of animals in early life can dramatically affect future performance, longevity, and well-being of these animals. We recently confirmed that pre-weaning calf nutrition can dramatically affect growth and development of the mammary gland and especially the quantity of epithelial tissue in the developing gland. Because these rudimentary mammary ducts give rise to the mammary tissue that will ultimately synthesis and secrete milk, these tissue precursors are important. In fact, calves with low or modest nutrient intake in the pre-weaning period produce significantly less milk later in life compared with those with a higher nutrition program. It is not unreasonable to view this enhanced pre-weaning feeding as a &#39;Head Start&#39; program for calves.Consequently, the first objective of our project is to learn the cellular and molecular factors that allow the improved mammary development in those calves better fed during the pre-weaning period. To address this objective we will randomly assign new born calves (n = 12) to a restricted (R) or enhanced (E) feeding regime. At weaning these animals will be sacrificed to provide tissues for analysis.We will measure the effects of these treatments on factors that correspond with mammary tissue growth. Measurements include: mammary tissue mass and composition [DNA, protein, lipid], mammary morphogenesis i.e. how the ductal elements actually develop [cellular stratification, development of myoepithelial cells], and quantitative multispectral imaging with immunocytochemistry. This last measure provides a way to measure the expression of proteins that we know impact development on a per cell basis. We will know what type of cells within the mammary gland is actually producing the protein and relatively how much. In the past most measures of protein expression required that the tissue sample be homogenized and expression compared relative to total tissue proteins. This imaging technique will give us very specific and novel information that relates protein expression to specific populations of defined cells in the developing mammary gland. Some of the proteins we will measure include estrogen and progesterone receptor, IGF-I receptor, incorporation of BrdU (relates to the rate of cell proliferation), and p63 (a marker of myoepithelial cells).A related hypothesis is that enhanced feeding alters myoepithelial cell development which modulates increased proliferation of epithelial cells and organization of mammary ductal structures. Our evaluation of myoepithelial cells in the bovine mammary gland is novel. Use of the p63 marker allows us determine the presence, location, and orientation of these cells in the developing tissue. In addition, mammary tissue collected will be cultured with graded concentrations of estradiol to measure acute gene expression responses to exposure to exogenous estrogen. This is a parallel to the experiment described below.A major hypothesis is that enhanced neonatal nutrition improves mammary development by increasing the responsiveness of mammary target cells to action of mammogenic hormones. We are focused on estrogen and signaling pathways known to have cross-talk with the estrogen receptor pathway, for example IGF-I. To test this hypothesis, calves (n = 24) will be assigned at birth to the two dietary treatments as described above. However, at weaning calves will be assigned to create the following treatment groups (n = 6/treatment): 1) calves fed R and given a placebo implant (R), 2) calves fed R and given an estradiol implant (R-E2), 3) calves fed E and given a placebo implant (E), and 4) calves fed E and given an estradiol implant (E-E2). Calves will be supplemented with estrogen for 2 weeks post-weaning, at which point all remaining animals will be harvested to assess the effects of estrogen within each diet on body and organ growth, particularly mammary gland growth. Measurements as described above will be applied to the tissues collected at sacrifice. In addition, collected tissue samples will be used to evaluate gene expression based on RNA sequence data. Combined with the appropriate bioinformatics analysis tools, this sequence data will provide a comprehensive evaluation of changes in expression of families of genes that regulate mammary growth and development and the impacts of diet and hormonal stimulation on expression of these genes.We expect the results of our project to provide important new information on the regulation of prepubertal bovine mammary development and to provide the impetus for nutritional and management tools to further improve &#39;Head Start&#39; programs for dairy replacement heifers.","Our long-term goal is to understand how enhanced neonatal nutrition in heifer calves influences future mammary development and function. More broadly we are interested in the impact of pre-weaning nutrition on general physiological growth and development, immunological function, health, and animal well-being. Think of this as &#39;Head Start&#39; for Calves.Specifically,we will determine cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow the marked increases in mammary ductal development in enhanced fed vs. control fed heifers we have observed. We are focused on estrogen and signaling pathways that cross-talk with the estrogen receptor pathway. This is because ovarian derived estrogen is the classic-core stimulator of mammary ductal development across essentially all mammals.A novel second objective is to determine if pre-weaning nutrition alters myoepithelial cell development which then acts to modulate increased proliferation of epithelial cells and development of appropriately organized mammary ductal structures. This objective comes from cancer and rodent studies that suggest myoepithelial cells (in addition to their well-recognized role in milk ejection in the mature lactating mammary gland) are also involved in regulation of mammary ductal growth and morphogenesis.Thethird objective is to test our hypothesis that pre-weaning diet alters the capacity of the mammary epithelial cells to response to mammary growth promoting signals. We will specifically determine if calves fed an enhanced diet vs. control diet express differences in their capacity to respond to exogenous estradiol (placebo implant vs. estrogen containing implant) as well as acute in vitro tissue response (mammary explant culture) to graded concentrations of estradiol added to the culture medium. For these explant tissues we will determine gene expression responses using a systems biology approach via RNA sequence analysis. ","estrogen, heifer, mammary gland, milk replacer"

Adler (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor, Biology Dept., University of Massachusetts AmherstFoundational program areas addressed: Agricultural systems and technology - This project investigates a potential biocontrol agent Plant health and production and plant products - This project investigates insect vectors of a major plant pathogen in highbush blueberry.Challenge areas addressed: Food safety - This project investigates a potential biocontrol agent to control mummyberry disease in highbush blueberry.Understanding the insect vectors, transmission efficiency, and fungal competitors of mummyberry disease (Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi) in highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)Plant diseases are common in agricultural systems and are major sources of loss for crops domestically and around the world. Mummyberry (Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi), is the most threatening pathogen to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) crops, with infections reducing crop yield up to 80% and causing major economic losses. In addition to distribution via wind and rain, pollinators and other insects vector the disease. Infected flowers develop inedible berries that drop, overwinter, and produce spores that begin a new cycle of infection.Resistance varies greatly within highbush blueberry cultivar, but the mechanisms of resistance are unclear, providing an area of research with great potential to improve yield. V. corymbosum is highly dependent on pollination services, and because pollinator species can vary in the efficiency of vectoring both pollen and fungal spores, it is important to assess whether cultivars differ in the abundance or composition of pollinator visits, and whether visitation differences correspond to likelihood of becoming infected. This is key to understanding the role of pollinator communities in cultivar resistance to mummyberry.Pollinators also differ in their pollen transfer efficiency. Mummyberry spores mimic pollen grains in the mode of delivery, therefore pollinators may also differ in their effectiveness as disease vectors. This proposal aims to identify differences in pollen/conidia transfer efficiency between pollinator taxa.Pilot study in this system has revealed a competing fungus present in some blueberry flowers that inhibits mummyberry growth in vitro. The last objective in this proposal seeks to assess mechanisms of competition between mummy-berry and Irpex lacteus, a potential biocontrol agent. ","Plant diseases are common in both natural and agricultural systems. Fungal pathogens are major sources of economic losses for agricultural fruit crops domestically and around the world. Additionally, crops such as grapes, kiwi, strawberry and blueberry are infected by a subset of fungal pathogens that specifically attack flowers. Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi, or mummyberry, is the most threatening pathogen to highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) crops, with infections reducing crop yield up to 80% and causing major economic losses. This fungus employs a two-stage infection process. Primary infection by mummy-berry spores creates &#39;pseudoflowers&#39; in new blueberry shoots, inducing production of a sugar-rich solution, while causing blighted shoots to reflect UV light and exude volatile organic compounds that mimic floral scent. In addition to distribution via wind and rain, pollinators and other insects visit the pseudoflowers and vector conidia, asexual fungal spores, to flowers. These spores mimic pollen grains by germinating on the stigma. Hyphal growth extends down the stylar canal from the conidium to the ovary, causing secondary infection. Infected flowers develop inedible berries that drop, overwinter, and produce spores that begin a new cycle of infection. Resistance varies greatly within highbush blueberry cultivar, but the mechanisms of resistance are unclear, providing an area of research with great potential to improve yield. Although my previous dissertation work and other studies have examined cultivar variation in resistance to mummyberry after conidia are vectored to the flower, nothing is known about whether cultivars also vary in their likelihood of receiving conidia due to differential pollinator attraction. Furthermore, Vaccinium corymbosum is highly dependent on pollination services, and therefore plants may experience a tradeoff between the benefits of pollination service and costs of disease transmission. Since pollinator species can vary in the efficiency of vectoring both pollen and conidia, it is important to assess whether cultivars differ in the abundance or composition of pollinator visits, and whether visitation differences correspond to likelihood of becoming infected. Pilot data indicates variation in pollinator communities visiting cultivars and that such variation corresponds with risk of infection. Thus, differences in pollinator preference or assemblage could explain variation in infection rates of highbush blueberry cultivars. Understanding pollinator preference between cultivars may allow growers to better manage their pollinator communities for reducing mummy-berry infection. The goal for Objective 1 is to Understand the role of pollinator communities in cultivar resistance to mummy-berry. In many systems, pollinators differ in their pollen transfer efficiency. Since mummy-berry conidia mimic pollen grains, pollinators may also differ in their effectiveness as disease vectors. This variation can be caused by pollinator differences in cuticular structure, body fit to flowers, or behavior like pollen grooming. Different pollinator species also vary in the frequency in which they contact points of primary and secondary infection. However, we do not know whether pollinators differ in per-visit rates of transfer of Monilinia conidia. This will be addressed by Objective 2, Identify differences in pollen/conidia transfer efficiency between pollinator taxa.  Nectar often possesses defensive or antimicrobial compounds, and therefore may play a role in resistance to fungal pathogens that infect floral tissues. In the spring of 2012 I began examining the role of nectar antimicrobials in mummy-berry resistance, collected nectar from local blueberry cultivars and tested whether nectar could inhibit the growth of mummy-berry in vitro. In unsterilized nectar treatments I found a distinct fungus that inhibited Monilinia growth, Irpex lacteus. I. lacteus is a common, wood-rot basidiomycete that parasitizes both plants and fungi, and produces antimicrobial/antifungal compounds. A pilot study demonstrated that Irpex lacteus arrested the growth of M. vaccinii-corymbosi in culture (see Obj 3, Preliminary Data), making it of interest as a biocontrol agent, just as Pseudomonas is used for biocontrol of Erwinia amylovora, fire blight on apples and pears. However, local isolates of M. vaccinii-corymbosi were not used in my pilot study, and the mechanism of inhibition is not yet known. I. lacteus could act as a hyphal parasite to M. vaccinii-corymbosi. Basidiomycetes can parasitize ascomycetes (Monilinia), and I. lacteus parasitizes Botrytis cinerea, a common fruit-rot fungus affecting grapes and strawberries. I. lacteus also produces antimicrobial and antifungal chemicals that inhibit ascomycetes. The next step in evaluating the biocontrol potential of I. lacteus is an in vitro experiment in which the nature of this inhibitory effect is characterized. This will be addressed in Objective 3: Assess mechanisms of competition between mummy-berry and Irpex lacteus, a potential biocontrol agent.",xxx
PROJECT,"UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC",1008008,2016-67013-24468,Enriching the gene pool of Upland cotton,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,370000.0,"Paterson, AN, H.",ACTIVE,"This standard research proposal addresses increasing utilization of naturally-occurring variation to enrich genetic diversity and accelerate breeding progress in one of the most economically important and genetically vulnerable major US crops, cotton. This research is founded on the discovery that naturally occurring day-neutral cotton genotypes capture a surprisingly large portion of the diversity available among exotic (short-day flowering) cotton races, in a breeder friendly form. Short-day flowering, adaptive in the native subtropical habitats of exotic cottons, dramatically reduces yields in the long days of temperate summers. This research will quantify phenotypic diversity (in field assessments) and genetic diversity (using genotyping-by-sequencing) of naturally day-neutral exotic cottons. Integrative analyses to predict phenotype from genotype will test hypotheses about roles of several types of candidate genes and genetic mechanisms in conferring economically important variation, and provide a framework for development and application of tools and information to accelerate breeding of finished cultivars, identifying exotic germplasm that (a) harbors favorable trait combinations of value to elite lines; and (b) offers new alleles/haplotypes to the elite cotton gene pool, also associating these with specific traits. Resulting data will permit researchers to (a) investigate evolutionary history of specific candidate genes (&#39;their favorite genes&#39;), or (b) search for genes that have specifically evolved under non-random processes. Partnership between a plant breeder and a genome biologist will integrate training in field-based breeding with effective utilization of genomic data and tools toward mitigating genetic vulnerability of cotton, in a manner that is also applicable to many other crops.","Activity 1.

It is therefore a promising feedstock for sustainable production of liquid biofuels. The major challenge to cost-effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is that it must be broken down into soluble sugars before it can be fermented. The overall goal of my PhD research is to develop highly efficient multi-species microbial consortia for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to isobutanol in one consolidated bioprocess. Three specific aims of this project are:To develop methods for generating Escherichia coli fermentation strains that perform reliably and effectively in co-culture with Trichoderma reesei.To introduce a white rot fungus species into the consortium in order to improve hydrolysis and reduce the need for thermochemical pretreatment.To develop novel methods for regulating the population composition of the microbial consortium and use it to optimize productivity. Aim 1 involves the development of improved strains via rational design and directed evolution. Aim 2 will involve testing a variety of strains for growth compatibility and then for improvement in sugar breakdown.

The virus induces severe diarrhea in infected pigs which is oftenfatal to newborn piglets. In 2014, an estimated 8 million piglets were killed by this disease in the United States. While some vaccines have been in use in parts of the world where PEDV is endemic for decades, the virus has thus far escaped vaccine control, suggesting the need for better vaccine candidates to control the US outbreak.Previous vaccines generated by passaging the virus in tissue culture have a characteristic deletion of all or part of open reading frame 3 (ORF3) along with other mutations. Outside of the host, ORF3 is not required, but loss of the gene seems to reducethe virus&#39;s ability to infect and replicate in the host. We will, therefore, use a strain of PEDV our laboratory has isolated from Colorado and mutate ORF3 on its own, leaving the rest of the virus as close to the circulating US strains as possible, with the idea of evaluating it as a vaccine candidate. Once the mutants are generated, we will look at changes in the viral life cycle in cell culture, as well as performing animal experiments with pigs to look for any reduction in disease severity for infected piglets.Ultimately, the goal of this project is to determine if ORF3 deleted PEDV is a viable vaccine candidate. If pathogenecity is reduced or removed in piglets, the virus can then be evaluated for its ability to stimulate an immune response in nursing sows which can be passed on to newborns to protect them from this disease. If succesful, a vaccine against PEDV would greatly curb the spread of PEDV through american hog farms.","The major goal of this project is to investigate the role of Open Reading Frame 3 (ORF3) in the viral pathogenesis of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) as a means of exploring ORF3 deletion as a vaccine generation candidate.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT,1007776,2016-67016-24863,Effects of poor maternal nutrition on muscle progenitor cell function and metabolism,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,150000.0,"Reed, SA, A.",ACTIVE,"As the world&#39;s population increases, there is a need to increase production efficiency and quantity of protein sources, including meat. Poor maternal nutrition (over- and restricted feeding) reduces muscle mass, alters muscle metabolism, and decreases expression of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) that control muscle development in the offspring, decreasing production efficiency and diminishing animal health. Insults to muscle progenitor cells (MPC) during fetal development likely contribute to both immediate and long-term negative outcomes. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that poor maternal nutrition (over- and restricted feeding) will negatively affect MPC in the offspring by 1) altering expression of MRFs and differentiation of MPC into myotubes, and 2) altering muscle cell metabolism. The specific objectives are to determine in offspring of poorly nourished ewes 1) the temporal expression of Pax7 and MRFs as MPC progress through myogenesis, 2) the ability of MPC to form myotubes, and 3) changes in MPC metabolism during development. Based on preliminary data, we expect that MPC from offspring of poorly nourished ewes will exhibit altered expression of MRFs, resulting in precocious differentiation. Metabolism in these MPC is expected to be more glycolytic and less oxidative, contributing to reduced feed efficiency in the postnatal animal. The findings from the proposed work will improve our understanding of how poor maternal nutrition contributes to altered body composition and metabolism, potentially leading to interventions to improve animal health and production efficiency.","The major goal of this project is to determine how poor maternal nutrition (over- and under-feeding) during gestation alters the function of muscle progenitor cells (MPC) during development.

However, at weaning calves will be assigned to create the following treatment groups (n = 6/treatment): 1) calves fed R and given a placebo implant (R), 2) calves fed R and given an estradiol implant (R-E2), 3) calves fed E and given a placebo implant (E), and 4) calves fed E and given an estradiol implant (E-E2). Calves will be supplemented with estrogen for 2 weeks post-weaning, at which point all remaining animals will be harvested to assess the effects of estrogen within each diet on body and organ growth, particularly mammary gland growth. Measurements as described above will be applied to the tissues collected at sacrifice. In addition, collected tissue samples will be used to evaluate gene expression based on RNA sequence data. Combined with the appropriate bioinformatics analysis tools, this sequence data will provide a comprehensive evaluation of changes in expression of families of genes that regulate mammary growth and development and the impacts of diet and hormonal stimulation on expression of these genes.We expect the results of our project to provide important new information on the regulation of prepubertal bovine mammary development and to provide the impetus for nutritional and management tools to further improve &#39;Head Start&#39; programs for dairy replacement heifers.","Our long-term goal is to understand how enhanced neonatal nutrition in heifer calves influences future mammary development and function. More broadly we are interested in the impact of pre-weaning nutrition on general physiological growth and development, immunological function, health, and animal well-being. Think of this as &#39;Head Start&#39; for Calves.Specific to our first objective we will determine cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow the marked increases in mammary ductal development in enhanced fed vs. control fed heifers we have observed. We are focused on estrogen and signaling pathways that cross-talk with the estrogen receptor pathway. This is because ovarian derived estrogen is the classic-core stimulator of mammary ductal development across essentially all mammals.A novel second objective is to determine if pre-weaning nutrition alters myoepithelial cell development which then acts to modulate increased proliferation of epithelial cells and development of appropriately organized mammary ductal structures. This objective comes from cancer and rodent studies that suggest myoepithelial cells (in addition to their well-recognized role in milk ejection in the mature lactating mammary gland) are also involved in regulation of mammary ductal growth and morphogenesis.Our third objective is to test our hypothesis that pre-weaning diet alters the capacity of the mammary epithelial cells to response to mammary growth promoting signals. We will specifically determine if calves fed an enhanced diet vs. control diet express differences in their capacity to respond to exogenous estradiol (placebo implant vs. estrogen containing implant) as well as acute in vitro tissue response (mammary explant culture) to graded concentrations of estradiol added to the culture medium. For these explant tissues we will determine gene expression responses using a systems biology approach via RNA sequence analysis.In tissues collected from calves, we will measure the effects of diet and estradiol stimulation on mammary growth (DNA, protein, lipid, tissue weight), morphogenesis (cellular stratification, development of myoepithelial cells), protein expression by cell type and structural classification (quantitative multispectral imaging and immunocytochemistry e.g. CD10, p63, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, IGF-I receptor, etc.), acute cell proliferation (incorporation of BrdU), and gene expression also using a systems biology approach.Moreover, the systems biology approach we will use to evaluate differences in gene expression differences in mammary tissue from control vs. accelerated fed calves and anticipated differential responses of these two groups of animals to mammogenic hormone stimulation (estradiol) offers unique opportunities to identify molecular, cellular, and biochemical pathways that control neonatal bovine mammary development and growth.These varied approaches will provide insight into how very early calf-hood nutrition acts to regulate subsequent mammary development, mammary function, and cow performance.","bovine, calf, mammary, nutrition"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,1007803,2016-67017-24430,Improving gut health with broccoli,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499998.0,"Miller, MI, JO.",ACTIVE,"Studies are emerging showing that broccoli, known as an anti-cancer food, may also prevent inflammation. This is of significance since inflammation aggravates both the chronic diseases of aging and diseases of the colon, including cancer and colitis. Broccoli is a rich source of phytonutrients, including the glycosides of the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol, as well as glucosinolates, a group of sulfur compounds that are relatively unique to the brassica vegetables. Upon hydrolysis, glucosinolates release bioactive compounds including sulforaphane (SULFORAPHANE), which is thought to be responsible for many of the health benefits of broccoli. However, studies by us and others suggest that SULFORAPHANE is not readily absorbed from cooked broccoli due to poor deconjugation by the gut microbiota. This is of concern, since most people eat broccoli cooked and therefore may not gain the potential health benefits.Our long-term goal is to optimize the positive impact that whole broccoli has on total body health. The overall objective of this project is to determine the interaction between the gut microbiota and whole broccoli, focusing on gut health. Our central hypothesis is that frequent broccoli ingestion alters the gut microbiome, reduces gut inflammation, and improves the bioavailability and bioactivity of SULFORAPHANE. We have chosen to perform this basic research in rodents, giving the greatest flexibility to dietary manipulation and tissue sampling and evaluation.","To achieve the objective of this application, we will pursue the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the impact of feeding broccoli on (1) the composition and (2) metabolism of the gut microbiota and (3) dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation. The working hypothesis is that frequent feeding of whole broccoli alters gut microbial composition and metabolism and reduces inflammation. Aim 2. Evaluate impact of broccoli pre-feeding on sulforaphane absorption and bioactivity, and determine if quercetin improves sulforaphane absorption. The working hypothesis is that pre-feeding broccoli, that improves glucoraphanin hydrolysis by the microbiota, will promote bioavailability and bioactivity of sulforaphane from cooked broccoli and that whole broccoli, specifically the quercetin in whole broccoli, will support sulforaphane bioavailability through suppressing efflux back into the gut lumen. Aim 3. Identify and characterize gut microbes with thio-hydrolyzing (myrosinase) activity. The working hypothesis is that our novel high-throughput approach will enable the identification of gut microbial myrosinases.","broccoli, glucosinolates, microbiota, myrosinase"

In objective 1, we will acquire a fundamental knowledge of the interaction of temperature, time, and sonication on the destruction of thermophilic/thermoduric vegetative microbes and spores in milk. Microbial reduction at optimal as well as realistic processing conditions will be determined. These conditions will be verified in objective 2 using a bench scale thermosonication system (up to 1 L/min with 35 sec sonication residence time) to determine the influence of flow-through thermosonication on microbial reduction. Changes in physio-chemical milk properties (color, pH, viscosity, oxidized lipids, sulfur compounds) will be determined and milk will be analyzed for free fatty acids, hydrolyzed protein, and surviving microbes over an 8 week shelf life as quality indicators. We will then integrate a sonicator into our USDA-inspected dairy processing plant for verification of enhanced shelf life and quality of milk at pilot scale using a flow rate of 1.7 L/min (10.6 second sonication residence time) (Objective 3). Consumer sensory analysis on thermosonicated, pilot scale processed milk will be conducted over an 8 week shelf life to verify consumer acceptance and will be correlated to shelf life quality analysis.

The tools will be developed and evaluated using mixtures of phospholipid and water, aggregated into various types of structured particles--materials found natively within foods or under development by food companies. The effect of the lipid structure on the partitioning of solutes between the lipid and water, and on the complex transport mechanisms for release of the solutes, can thereby be determined.

The production of birch syrup can be a means for producers to increase the revenues and profitability of their farms and operations, while helping to meet growing consumer demand for natural, locally-produced food with excellent quality and flavor. However, there is currently no information, particularly science-based data from controlled experiments, available for birch syrup producers on the processing techniques necessary to consistently produce syrup with the best possible flavor and quality. This is particularly important for birch syrup production, as the composition of its sap renders it susceptible to the development of objectionable flavors, and small changes in processing conditions can result in significant reductions in the acceptability of syrup flavor.Thus, the overall goal of this project is to develop standard processing practices for producing pure birch syrup with optimal flavor and quality. This overall goal will be accomplished by first conducting controlled experiments with commercial equipment to determine the processing practices which consistently result in syrup with the most preferred flavor. Experiments will be conducted in which birch syrup is produced simultaneously from the same sap using different processing practices, and subsequent sensory evaluation experiments will be conducted to determine which technique produced birch syrup with the most preferred flavor. These data and results will then be used to generate standard practices required to consistently produce pure birch syrup with the best possible flavor and quality, and this information will be communicated to producers throughout the U.S. through online seminars, presentations, websites, and written technical articles. Producers will be able to use this knowledge and implement these processing practices to ensure that the birch syrup they produce will have the best possible flavor and quality, and thus the highest possible economic value. This will help make certain that consumers are consistently sold birch syrup with superior flavor and quality, and thus that demand for pure birch syrup continues to grow.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA,1007916,2016-67012-24697,Mechanisms Underlying a High-Androgen Microenvironmental and Associated Infertility in Cattle,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,141940.0,"Romereim, SA.",ACTIVE,"Maintaining a reproductively-viable herd is vital to the prosperity and productivity of the beef industry. There are currently strategies to increase pregnancy rates, but many cows (8-13%) still exhibit signs of anovulatory infertility. Our lab has identified a subpopulation of cows (~10%) with endocrine and follicular profiles indicating sporadic anovulatory infertility (SPOV). These SPOV cows have high intrafollicular androstenedione (30-fold elevation) in the dominant follicle compared to ovulatory cows (OV) but lack a corresponding increase in estradiol. Microarray analyses comparing ovarian somatic cells from SPOV and OV cows identified pathways associated with inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation through decreased expression of cell cycle progression genes, increased expression of genes promoting granulosa cell death, and increased expression of viability genes in theca cells. Therefore, our hypothesis is that SPOV follicles experience theca cell androgen overproduction and inefficient granulosa cell estrogen production due in part to misregulation of cell proliferation and survival, ultimately creating a follicular microenvironment that prevents ovulation. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) Investigating if granulosa cells subjected to a high-androgen environment exhibit cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and perturbation of lipid metabolic pathways, thereby inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens; and 2) Determining if a pharmacologically-induced high-androgen, low-estrogen environment reproduces the characteristics of bovine sporadic anovulation. The results of this research will provide a better understanding of the follicular microenvironment and its contribution to anovulatory phenotype and female infertility, allowing for enhanced fertility in beef cows or culling of reproductively inefficient females.","Profitability of a beef herd is linked to the ability of a heifer or cow to predictably breed within the first 21 days of the breeding season, allowing her to maintain a 365-day calving interval and wean a marketable calf each year (1). Achieving this timing is largely dependent on cows predictably ovulating each estrous cycle. Recent work in normally menstruating women demonstrated that 8-13% of these women were not consistently ovulating for two consecutive reproductive cycles, which could delay potential pregnancies (2, 3). Cattle appear to have similar problems, with approximately 10% of females displaying chronic or sporadic anovulation where an oocyte is not consistently matured/released every estrous cycle (4-6). Anovulatory infertility in humans is associated with high concentrations of androgens within the developing ovarian follicle (7, 8). Our lab has shown that the same high-androgen ovarian conditions are correlated with decreased fertility due to anovulation in cattle (6). This population of anovulatory cows has a 17% reduction in calving rate (P &lt; 0.07, (6)) as well as endocrine and follicular development profiles that resemble those of women with chronic or sporadic anovulation. These cows exhibit excess androstenedione (A4) accumulation in their follicular fluid (&gt;30 fold higher) and lack an increase in estrogen (E2) production of similar magnitude (only 2 to 4 fold higher)(6). This extreme hormone imbalance within the developing ovarian follicle is likely a crucial aspect of the sporadic anovulation phenotype, but what we do not know are the underlying mechanisms linking the high-androgen microenvironment to granulosa and theca cell dysfunction and, ultimately, anovulation. Our long-term research goal is to use these cows to improve our understanding of the causes of bovine infertility to develop infertility markers for use in selection programs or management procedures that overcome anovulation, thus ensuring better reproductive success within the livestock industry. To better understand the causes of sporadic anovulation, our lab performed microarray analyses on the granulosa cells from control cows with lower A4 concentrations and normal ovulation (designated OV; n=4, A4 mean=9 ng/ml) compared to the high-A4/sporadic anovulatory subpopulation (SPOV; n=5, follicular A4 mean=102 ng/mL). Based on microarray statistical testing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found that granulosa cells from the SPOV population exhibit changes in genes that are indicative of a strong inhibition of the cell cycle and increased apoptosis. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that there is a feed-forward mechanism in these SPOV follicles in which high androgen concentrations lead to decreased granulosa cell proliferation and cell number, thereby amplifying the androgen accumulation because there are fewer cells to convert A4 to E2. This proposal will also investigate the possibility that dysfunctional lipid metabolism contributes to the altered steroidogenesis in SPOV cows as it has been shown to do in women with sporadic anovulation.Objective 1: Determine if granulosa cells exposed to high androgen concentrations undergo cell cycle arrest, leading to a decrease in proliferation rate and total granulosa cell number. We will test our working hypothesis that granulosa cells in SPOV follicles are undergoing cell cycle arrest with a corresponding decrease in cell number as well as altered steroidogenesis, correlated with systemically modified lipid metabolism, in response to the high-androgen environment. We will conduct both primary granulosa cell culture and in vivo experiments with the SPOV and OV cows to determine if this high A4 environment causes the reduced granulosa cell numbers and altered lipid metabolism.Objective 2: Determine whether an induced persistent follicle environment reproduces the characteristics of bovine sporadic anovulation. To test the working hypothesis that intrafollicular androgen accumulation in vivo is sufficient to induce a sporadic anovulation phenotype, we will use an aromatase inhibitor (Letrozole) to induce a follicular environment with a high androgen-to-estrogen ratio in normally OV cows at a critical timepoint during the estrous cycle. Moreover, we will also determine if these follicles have reduced cell numbers, decreased cell proliferation, and altered lipid profiles. These results will establish that granulosa cell malfunction is sufficient to produce a sporadic anovulatory phenotype.1.

Despite the fact that small peptides (a very short form of proteins) emerged as a new class of plant hormones twenty years ago, our understanding of this type of hormone still lags behind other phytohormone research, particularly in crops. While there are hundreds of peptide receptors present in the plant genomes, only a small number of peptides have been discovered so far. Research on small peptide hormones is largely limited by lack of a systematic approach for identifying them. In this project, I will utilize a cutting edge technique to monitor global protein synthesis in tomato root development and subsequently identify new peptides that promote growth. The approach that I will develop can be applied to different plant organs as well as other crops; thus this study will benefit the plant community in two key ways by advancing our understanding of peptide hormones and how they act to modulate plant growth, as well as improvement of genome annotation in crops. The potential peptide hormones will be validated and tested immediately in tomato with the potential to apply them to other crops to facilitate agricultural improvement.",The ultimate goal of this project is to identify novel peptide hormones involved in root development in order to facilitate crop improvement.

PROJECT,MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY MOORHEAD,1007942,2016-67014-24467,Role of pyruvate phosphate dikinase regulatory protein isoform-2 in Zea mays C4 photosynthesis,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,148684.0,"Chastain, CH, J..",ACTIVE,"Corn (maize, Zea mays) is our nation&#39;s most extensively grown crop in terms of acreage planted. It is also by far the highest yielding of all the grain crops (e.g., compare U.S. average 160 bu./acre for maize versus soybeans, 43 bu./acre, and wheat, 46 bu./acre). The higher yield potential of maize is attributable to a specialized photosynthesis process, termed C4 photosynthesis, that maize leaves use for fixing CO2 into carbohydrate. In contrast, all the other major grain crops, with the exception of Sorghum, rely on a more widely occurring photosynthesis process termed ""C3"" photosynthesis. The difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis in terms of productivity (i.e., carbohydrate synthesized per unit of absorbed sunlight) is striking. By using C4 photosynthesis, maize leaves can synthesize twice the amount of carbohydrate from assimilated CO2 versus grain crops that utilize C3 photosynthesis. Because of the huge productivity advantage conferred by C4 photosynthesis several consortiums of plant scientists world-wide are now organized with the expressed aim of engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species such as rice. Recent studies estimate that a ""C4"" rice would yield up to 60% more grain than present day C3 rice cultivars. To enable the introduction of this powerful photosynthetic engine into C3 crop species, a comprehensive understanding of how C4 photosynthesis is biochemically regulated in leaves will need to be gained. This research project will expand our knowledge in this area by elucidating how a newly discovered enzyme in maize leaves called pyruvate phosphate dikinase isoform 2 (PDRP2) biochemically regulates the C4 photosynthesis enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Our working hypothesis is that PDRP2 functions to biochemically inactivate PPDK enzyme that inadvertently accumulates in a specialized leaf cell called bundle sheath (BS) cell. According to current models of C4 photosynthesis, the presence of any PPDK in the BS cells would result in a short circuiting of the photosynthetic process. We propose that PDRP2 prevents such a short circuit from ever developing by ensuring that any PPDK that appears in this cell type will be rendered catalytically dead. This hypothesis will be experimentally examined using principally immunological (antibody dependent) methods. These methods include high resolution western blotting and confocal microscopy. In parallel to these experiments, an in-depth investigation into the biochemical properties of PDRP2 will be conducted to better understand the mechanism of how PDRP2 catalyzes biochemical regulation of PPDK. In all, this project will contribute essential knowledge to those efforts aimed at engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species.","GoalsThe major goal of this project will be to elucidate how the enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase regulatory protein, isoform-2 (PDRP2), participates in the biochemical regulation of the C4 photosynthetic pathway in maize leaves. This enzyme was discovered only recently and its role in the regulation of the C4 pathway unknown. Revealing its role in C4 pathway regulation will significantly advanced our fundamental knowledge of how C4 photosynthesis functions in leaves. We will deduce this role by experimentally providing experimental evidence that will support or refute either one of two alternate hypotheses:hypotheses 1: PDRP2 is a monofunctional regulatory enzyme - therefore, the exclusive role of PDRP2 in C4 photosynthesis is to block the flow of pyruvate into PEP by irreversibly inactivating PPDK enzyme;hypothesis 2: PDRP2 is a bifunctional regulatory enzyme - therefore, the exclusive role of PDRP2 in C4 photosynthesis is to moderate the flow of pyruvate into PEP via reversible, up-/down activation and inactivation of PPDK enzyme.Objectives1. Determine the cell specific localization of PDRP isoform 1. Is PDRP 1 specifically expressed and localized to leaf mesophyll cell chloroplasts?2. Determine the cell specific localization of PDRP isoform 2. Is PDRP 2 specifically expressed and localized to leaf bundle sheath cell chloroplasts?3. Determine the steady-state level of PPDK enzyme in bundle sheath cell chloroplasts relative to PPDK enzyme in mesophyll cell chloroplasts. How much PPDK is actually expressed in BS cells?4. Determine the invitro enzyme function(s) of PDRP2. Is PDRP2 a monofunctional regulatory enzyme........does PDRP2 possess only protein kinase activity and not a protein phosphotransferase activity?......Or is PDRP2 a bifunctional enzyme possessing both protein kinase and protein phosphotransferase enzyme functions?5. Determine the activation state of PPDK in BS cell chloroplasts. Is PPDK in BS chloroplasts irreversibly inactivated?","c4 photosynthesis, enzyme regulation, maize, zea mays"

Sometimes PGPR work reliably, and cost effectively. Often, however, PGPR are ineffective because they do not reach their sites of action on plant roots. This can be caused by: restricted movement of PGPR through soil; inefficient water-based transport of PGPR or competition with endogenous soil bacteria.We propose that soil protists have the capacity to move PGPR and that they could increase PGPR effectiveness by allowing PGPR to keep up with growing roots. We will isolate from Medicago truncatulaand soybean rhizospheres 30 types of cyst-forming protists. These will be characterized in an in vitro micromodel to select those that best transport bacteria to legume roots. In vitro data will be used to derive agent-based models of protist transport. The top 8 PGPR-moving protists will be used in a series of increasingly realistic experiments to determine their effectiveness in moving rhizobial bacteria. Experiments will measure the effects of protists on: rhizobial transport through soil, rhizobial effectiveness with competitors and rhizobial effectiveness on established roots.Rhizobia, the most frequently used PGPR for nutrient acquisition, are inoculated on soybean, alfalfa, bean, pea, clover and other legumes to provide cheap and sustainable nitrogen. Their use could increase if inoculation was more effective. Nitrogen acquisition in nonlegumes, phosphate acquisition, iron acquisition and biocontrol are also facilitated by PGPR and may be enhanced by protist transport of PGPR.","The long term goal of this project is to test the hypothesis thatplant nutrition can be enhanced by developing an inoculation technology that uses soil protists to increase targeting of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria ot the roots of agricultural crops. Our objectives for this project are:Within 6 months of project start, isolate, purify, and identify 30 non-pathogenic cyst-forming protist lines (Aims A1 and A2, year 1).Within 15 months, evaluate protist-facilitated transport using the emulated soil micromodel assay (Aim A3) and down-select to the 8 best protists for greenhouse experiments (Aim A3, year 2).Within 21 months, measure PFT in sterile soil pot assays for 8 protists types with 15 replicates per treatment plus appropriate controls. 3 independent trials.

Forest lands also contribute to the economic viability of agriculture. In Florida alone, they contribute over $12bn/year in economic outputs and support over 90,000 jobs. These lands are increasingly under pressure from threats including land use change, climate variability, and invasive species. Addressing these problems is a major US policy goal; yet we know relatively little about the public&#39;s preferences for processes used to implement environmental policies/programs. My recent work (e.g., my dissertation research) revealed public preferences are in fact linked with program processes, which is important for designing environmental policies that reduce tradeoffs and enhance synergies between the agricultural economy and environmental benefits such clean water resources.The project has two phases used to assess the social acceptability and economic effectiveness of using payments for ecosystem services (PES) incentive programs to stem the loss of forestland, protect ecosystem services and increase financial sustainability of agricultural operations. In phase one I will use a generalized Faustmann model for loblolly pine stands to simulate the impacts of employing Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water resource protection on the net present value of forest outputs (e.g., timber) for eight representative sites in four heavily-forested southeastern states (FL, GA, SC, MS). Model results will identify tradeoffs in financial impacts and production of ecosystem services and timber. These results will inform phase two, the development of a stated preference valuation survey of the public in these states to identify levels of social support for alternative environmental programs given the tradeoffs in forest outputs and other important attributes: land protection method (e.g., permanent easements), institutional involvement (e.g., public), and cost. The valuation survey will employ a relatively novel stated preference valuation approach (best-worst choice) and econometric methods. Methodologically, this project is unique for its integration of forest stand-level modeling and stated preference valuation techniques.Results will fill critical knowledge gaps on public preferences for landowner incentive programs that can be used to inform economic tradeoffs associated with policies that sustain agricultural communities while protecting important ecosystem services. Importantly, the integrated project also includes the development of Extension products to inform key stakeholders about the tradeoffs inherent in alternative approaches to protecting forestland. The proposed project directly addresses the mission of AFRI and the four-part goal outlined by the National Research Council Committee: to satisfy the agricultural needs of humans, enhance environmental quality, sustain the economic viability of agriculture and enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. Together with the mentoring and training dimensions of the project (see Project Narrative), the proposed project also meets the AFRI-ELI program goal of helping prepare the next generation of scientists because it will move my research in a direction that would set me apart in my field, give me skills to build an independent research program in forest economics and policy and preparethe Post-DoctoralAssociatefor a tenure-track university faculty position.","The overall goal for this project is to providethePost-Doctoral Associatewith additional research skills and experiences, research outputs, teaching skills and experiences, extension outputs and experiences, and active mentoring to acquire a tenure-track faculty position at a public university in the US. Consistent with this goal, this project will help thePost-Doctoral Associateestablish and grow an independent research and extension program in natural resource economics and policy that addresses emerging threats to working forests and associated ecosystem services, and examines innovative policy solutions in this context. This project aligns with thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s long-term goals of conducting science and generating new knowledge to inform public and private decisions about forest land management and ecosystem services, and teaching and mentoring a new generation of scientists to improve American capacity to address complex problems at the nexus between forests and society.Specific research- and extension-related goals include: (1) Increase thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s research and statistical software skillset through the successful completion of the research project and by attending at least two professional development mini-courses focused on experimental design, data collection, and/or modeling; (2) Increase thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s publishing success in top-tier journals by working with thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s primary mentor to prepare and submit at least four journal articles for peer review in well-respected journals, and publish at least two papers already in review; (3) Increase thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s research funding success by working with thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s mentor to co-organize and co-write at least one small (funding &lt;$50,000; PI) and one large proposal (funding &gt;$300,000; co-PI), and attending at least one grant writing workshop offered by the University of Florida; (4) Expand thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s extension/outreach experiences and outputs by completing the project; and (5) Increase thePost-Doctoral Associate&#39;s understanding of how to evaluate an extension program via collaboration with staff in the Florida Forest Stewardship Program (FFSP), an award-winning Extension program at the University of Florida. The FFSP works with non-industrial private forest (NIPF) landowners to inform and encourage improved land stewardship practices, and is successful in changing behavior in hundreds of landowners every year.The goal of the researchproject is to (1) examine how public welfare is impacted by environmental programs that alter forest landownership and the local timber economy and (2) disseminate the results of my research to key decision-makers to advance the long term goals of this project.Specific objectives are to:Assess how watershed BMPs impact forest outputs (e.g., timber revenue) on private industrial and non-industrial forest lands in the Southeastern U.S.Assess public WTP for watershed protection programs based on how they alter landownership (e.g., conservation easement, cost-share) and how they impact the local timber economy.Develop Extension products to communicate to decision-makers how to protect public benefits while supporting private forest lands.","economic analysis, environment, forest landowners, payment for ecosystem services, public goods"

The ability of plant-associated microbes to cause disease depends on virulence factors that manipulate host targets, often to alter host physiology, suppress host defenses, and/or promote disease symptoms. Thus, breeding, transgenic, or crop treatment strategies for combating plant disease will benefit from advanced fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms employed by virulence factors of pathogens and their targets in plants. The AvrE-family of virulence effectors are secreted from multiple genera of plant pathogenic bacteria into the cells of host plants, contributing to disease on a wide variety of crops ranging from monocots (e.g. maize) to dicots (e.g. tomato and bean) to fruit trees (e.g. apple and pear). Despite the widespread importance of this family of virulence factors, little is known about their mechanism of action. Preliminary data indicate that the AvrE-family effectors interact with a regulatory subunit of a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A plays key roles in the regulation of numerous plant processes, including responses to abiotic and biotic stress. We will describe the AvrE-PP2A interaction, determine its subcellular localization, and characterize the consequence on plant defense, including hormone and metabolic signals. Since the AvrE-family virulence effectors are widespread, the crop plants negatively affected by associated diseases are varied and numerous, and PP2A isoforms are key to a variety of plant responses to the environment, the potential long-range benefits to U.S. agriculture from applying the knowledge generated by this study will be broad and significant.","1. Define the interactions between PP2A, AvrE-family T3Es and potential substrates. We will identify the AvrE-interacting subunits of PP2A, define the interacting domains, and apply the new knowledge to inhibit AvrE activity and identify putative substrates in planta.2. Define the subcellular localization of the AvrE-family effectors and PP2A subunits. Various in planta approaches will be used to localize the AvrE-family T3Es and B&#39; subunits of PP2A, as well as how their localization is affected by their interaction.3. Define the role of PP2A isoforms in plant defense and the consequences of their targeting by AvrE-family T3Es.

PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,1008490,2016-67013-24816,Triggering Plant Basal Immunity: Characterization Of Fungal Genes And Plant Responses Underpinning Activation Of Host Basal Defense,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499830.0,"Donofrio, NI, M.",ACTIVE,"According to the latest information from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, rice is consumed by roughly three and a half of the world&#39;s seven billion people. Unfortunately, IRRI also discovered that farmers, on average, lose 37% of their rice yield to diseases and pests, per year. One of the most devastating diseases of rice that occurs on a global scale is caused by a fungus named Magnaporthe oryzae, and causes rice blast disease. Every year, rice blast kills enough rice to feed sixty million people. Methods to combat this fungus include utilizing genes for resistance that naturally occur in different rice isolates, as well as fungicides. While these methods have some efficacy, they are not long-lived. Once these selection pressures are placed upon the fungal populations in the fields, the fungus must adapt to the resistant rice lines or fungicides, or it will die. There are many documented cases of the fungus adapting to the new environment, and effectively ""overcoming"" either the rice resistance gene, or the fungicide. In fact, others&#39; research has demonstrated that it takes roughly three years for the fungus to overcome a new rice resistance gene once it has been deployed in the field. Plants have two types of main resistance mechanisms; they have a very strong, very effective resistance called ""R-gene"" mediated resistance, and they have a slower and weaker resistance called ""basal"" resistance. The problem with the former type of resistance was described above. Such a strong type of resistance forces the fungus to switch up its genes, and adapt to its new environment. A new R-gene resistant cultivar of rice can look great one season, but then the next season, it can become totally decimated by the ""evolved"" fungus in the field. Recently, pathologists are digging more deeply into basal resistance. Plants are constantly being challenged with microbes and pests; while most of them will be non-pathogens on the plant, some will gain entrance and start to attack. Basal resistance limits the spread of these pathogens, so that either the plant can grow enough to reproduce, or at least not succumb to disease immediately.Both types of resistances involve plant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Just as in humans, ROS are a double-edged sword for plants. They are necessary for proper development, however in excess, they can have deleterious effects, or even be directly toxic. We are studying the role of ROS in the rice-rice blast fungus interaction, in order to determine whether certain secretions from the fungus are actually triggering the ROS part of the basal resistance. We have some preliminary data that indicates, yes, the fungus has certain pathways that activate, and actually trigger the rice plant&#39;s basal resistance. Indeed, when these pathways in the fungus are disrupted, the rice basal response is even stronger, and the pathogen causes less disease. This is a great thing! Our goal is to identify more such pathways in the fungus, in order to determine all the signals that regulate the rice plant&#39;s basal resistance. And from the rice side, we will examine the rice genes that respond specifically to these fungal signals. We are using ""high-throughput"" technologies to examine as many genes and signals in both the plant and the fungus, at the same time. This method is both comprehensive and time-efficient. Ultimately, if we can ascertain the fungal signals that turn up the plant&#39;s basal resistance, as well as all the genes involved in this response, then we might be able to breed rice lines that are primed to respond to fungal attack with a stronger basal resistance response. This type of resistance, typically governed by numerous genes in the plant, is much harder for the fungus to adapt to, and would therefore provide durable, long-lasting resistance in the field.","Plants have both basal and acquired immunity in order to ward off invaders including fungi, bacteria and viruses. While the latter generates a strong burst of defense responses, usually resulting in death of the invader and of the few host cells that have been breached, the former generates a slower, weaker defense response that is nonetheless incredibly important. Basal immunity is arguably the reason why the majority of plants in the environment are able to persist and successfully reproduce. However we have thus far been unable to truly understand and harness the nature of basal immunity in plants. We pose the question of whether we can ""turn up"" this natural, and usually broad spectrum immune system in plants to more successfully combat pathogens. In order to do this, we must understand the pathogen ""triggers"" of basal immunity. For many years, it has been well-understood by research, including some of our own, that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role both as a signal and as a stressor duing various plant pathogen interactions. ROS is certainly part of the strong acquired immune response, but our work and others have shown it to play a role in basal immunity as well. Furthermore, our work demonstrates a strong link between nutrient acquisition in the fungus, and suppression of host defenses including those that involve ROS.Our goal is to better understand how reactive oxygen species management in plant pathogenic fungi (specifically the rice blast fungus), regulate the host (in this case, rice) basal immune response. Another way to phrase this is to pose the question, what are the fungal effectors from the rice blast fungus, that modulate ROS levels in rice, a key part of the basal immune system. Ultimately, the long-term goal would be understand this particular interplay, in order to breed rice varieties that have enhanced, ROS-driven basal defenses. To do this, we proposed three specific, measurable Objectives as follows:1. Identify fungal genes involved in ROS perception, signaling and nutrient acquisition usingforward genetic screens.2. Evaluate differentially pathogenic rice-fungal interactions using RNA-seq and live-cell imaging.3. Evaluate metabolic changes in pools of ATP and NADPH in the fungus during infection.While the research of many others has proven that effector molecules differ widely from pathogen to pathogen, it is possible that there might be a common suite amongst plant pathogenic fungi that trigger ROS-related basal immunity. However even if this is not the case, the methods we will deploy to obtain our goals should be widely applicable to other systems. ","fungus, rice"

A. americanum is uniquely associated with symptoms of red meat hypersensitivity, and the geographic range of A. americanum includes states with highly rural populations. Given the nature of agriculture, forestry, and livestock workforce, there will inevitably be tick encounters simply by living in areas where A. americanum also resides.

Identifying plant mechanisms that regulate symbiotic nodule development in legumes will enable mechanism-based strategies to optimize biological nitrogen fixation, transfer this trait to non-legumes, and thus reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Existing knowledge indicates that a balance between auxinand cytokinin,two key plant hormones, is crucial for proper nodule development in soybean. It is not known how plants achieve a precise balance between these hormones to enable proper nodule development. This research project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge byidentifying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the balance between auxin and cytokinin,two key plant hormones,isregulated during soybean nodule development.Through a previous research project funded by NIFA-AFRI, the PD&#39;s lab identified that a regulatory module comprised of a regulatory RNA (microRNA160) dictates developmental stage-specific sensitivities to auxin and cytokinin, and directs proper nodule formation and maturation in soybean. microRNA160 functions by regulating the levels of a family of transcription factors belonging to the ARF10/16/17 family (referred to as ARF10) that suppress the action of auxin.The major objective in this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ARF10 proteins regulate auxin-cytokinin balance and subsequent nodule development. Therationalehere is that knowledge on these mechanisms will meaningfully contribute to strategies for optimizing nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, and potentially transfer this trait to non-legumes.Methods and approaches:The research project willdetermine the sites of GmARF10 activitythrough molecular probing and microscopy analysis; identify and validate its interacting partner proteins through protein-protein interactions assays in yeast and in soybean plants; identify and validate its direct downstream targets using high throughput sequencing andin vitro binding assays; and evaluate the role of a selected set of ARF10 effectors and downstream targets in nodule development through loss of function assays.Ultimate goal(s):The long-term goal of this research is to sustainably meet our agricultural nitrogen needs and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.Studying nodule development in soybean, a major food, feed and potential biofuel crop, is of high relevance to modern U.S agriculture. U.S. farmers used ~13 million tons of nitrogen in 2011 costing them on average $10 billion (USDA-ERS data) which could be significantly reduced through enhancement ofbiological nitrogen fixation. Reduced use of chemical fertilizers also helps sustain clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations.","Identifying plant mechanisms that regulate symbiotic nodule development in legumes will enable mechanism-based strategies to optimize biological nitrogen fixation, transfer this trait to non-legumes, and thus reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.

PROJECT,SAES - NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008560,2016-67014-24806,Development of a new approach to further characterize pathogen virulence mechanisms in the wheat tan spot disease system,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,150000.0,"Liu, ZH.",ACTIVE,"Tan spot of wheat, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an economically important disease in many wheat-growing areas worldwide. The fungal pathogen is highly diverse in pathogen virulence with at least eight races having been described. So far, only three necrotrophic effectors (NEs), namely Ptr ToxA, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, have been identified as virulence factors, and also the fungal genes for Ptr ToxC production have not been identified. Recent evidence has suggested additional NEs and other genetic factors are importantly involved in wheat-P. tritici-repentis interactions. Despite a high quality genome sequence being available for the pathogen, characterization of P. tritici-repentis virulence/pathogenicity factors is incomplete compared to other important fungal pathogens. The fungus is homothallic in nature, which does not allow us to develop fungal populations and characterize virulence genes using genetic tools. We propose here to manipulate the fungal mating type system to create heterothallic strains, use these heterothallic strains to develop fungal populations, and perform genetic analysis as a new approach for identifying P. tritici-repentis virulence genes that are undetectable using current methods. Specifically, the genes governing the production of Ptr ToxC and encoding novel virulence/pathogenicity factors will be identified in this project. Further characterization of fungal virulence will not only improve the understanding of the disease system, but also provide knowledge and tools for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance to tan spot.","The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is the causal agent of wheat tan spot which is a destructive disease on both common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (T. turgidum L.) worldwide. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the understanding of this disease system by further characterizing the pathogen virulence genes and elucidating the underlying mechanisms how they interact with the host. The disease system is known to involve fungal-produced necrotrophic effectors (NE), namely Ptr ToxA, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, that interact with corresponding host sensitivity genes in an inverse gene-for gene manner to cause necrosis or chlorosis on sensitive lines. However, recent evidence has suggested that this system involves additional uncharacterized NEs and other type of genetic factors. The causal fungus (Ptr) is homothallic, precluding the development of fungal population and characterization of the pathogenicity/virulence genes using the power of genetic mapping. Our goal for this project is to develop a new approach to further identify Ptr virulence genes through converting the fungal mating system, following by development of fungal populations and genetic mapping of virulence genes. The specific objectives are 1)Develop various fungal populations involving different races and construct the genetic maps of the fungus, 2) Map novel virulence genes and those responsible for the production of Ptr ToxC in P. tritici-repentis.","fungal virulence, necrotrophic effector, pyrenophora tritici-repentis, wheat, Mating type"

Since the move to indoor farrowing in the 1950s and the increasing intensity of production operations (e.g. increase in operation size, continuous farrowing), the conventional farrowing crate has been the standard for farrowing housing. However, while over the decades the production has seen an increase in sow size, piglet numbers, and weaning weights, the design of the conventional farrowing crate has remained relatively unchanged. Design guides like the Midwest Plan Service Swine Housing and Equipment Handbook (MWPS, 1983) recommend the same 1.5 x 2.1 m farrowing crate that is common in industry today. Some producers have started to increase the crate size on their farms to accommodate the larger sows and litters. This increase in crate size is not based on trials or experimental data, rather the opinion of the production staff that more space is needed. When the production data are examined, their motivation becomes clear.From 2007 to 2012, the U.S. swine industry averages for the total born and number born alive increased by 1.1 and 1.2 piglets per sow per farrowing event, respectively. However, in that same time span the average number of piglets weaned has only increased by 0.8 piglets per sow per farrowing event while the pre-weaning mortality has increased from 14.2 to 15.5%. This prewean mortality rate, coupled with the increased birth rate, means that 1.9 piglets per litter that are born alive are lost before weaning. Since the cost of maintaining a sow through breeding, gestation and farrowing is generally fixed and independent of litter size, a 1% change in prewean mortality rate approximately equates to an 11% change in fixed cost per piglet weaned. Reducing prewean mortality by a small amount would have a significant impact on the swine industry, and producers would be highly motivated to adopt relatively small increases in pen area or proactive management strategies.Immediately after parturition, it is vitally important for the piglets to find the udder and to begin accessing colostrum. Those piglets that take longer to reach the udder and suckle colostrum have lower antibody titers, greater drop in body temperature and greater risk of mortality. Rapid identification of piglets that have not ingested adequate colostrum would allow for human intervention to increase the survival chances of the piglet.This study is expected to yield the following outcomes: a) provide recommendations to producers on number and location of localized heating sources, b) provide foundational data for new farrowing crate designs and future research, c) evaluate feasibility of using thermography for piglet health evaluation, and d) evaluate the use of a low-cost IR gun to detect low colostrum consumption by piglets. Through this intensive evaluation of piglet and sow behaviors, future research efforts will be better guided.","The overall goal for this project is to enhance the health and well-being of pre-weaning piglets through better understanding the sow&#39;s diurnal posture pattern, meeting the thermal and space needs of modern commercial litters, and prompt detection of undernourished or ""fallback"" piglets or the onset of disease. To achieve this goal, this multidisciplinary study will evaluate sow posture pattern and piglet performance and behavior in farrowing crates with varying space. Specific objectives are as follows.Evaluate the impact of different farrowing crate size/layout (conventional crate, expanded creep area crate, expanded sow and creep area crate) equipped with one vs. two localized heat sources on pre-weaning piglet health and mortality.Quantify postural behaviors of sows before parturition and during lactation as affected by crate size/layout and localized heat source (1 vs. 2); and distribution of piglets in the crate.Assess the relationship between surface temperature of the piglets and their health status.","behavior, health, welfare, Piglet, preweaning"

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT,1008604,2016-67024-24620,Measuring the Food and Agriculture Economy,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499872.0,"Dunn, RI, AL.",ACTIVE,"Measuring the full contribution of food and agriculture industries (FAI) to the US economy requires coordinated reporting of business activity along the entire food-and-fiber supply chain. Currently, however, NASS reporting responsibilities do not include off-farm activity and other federal statistical agencies lack a clear mandate to report on FAI in manufacturing, transportation, wholesale and retail trade, and service sectors. As a consequence, answers to many pressing public policy questions that demand quality data on the full range of FAI cannot be addressed.In response to this significant data and research gap, we propose initiation of an ambitious long-run project to develop the methodologies, institutional partnerships, and research collaborations necessary to expand statistical-agency reporting on FAI. This proposal is the first step in that process, utilizing existing data collected by the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service to define and measure Agricultural Services (AS)--the non-manufacturing establishments directly upstream or downstream from the farm-gate in the food-and-fiber supply chain.Because NASS undertakes data collection of on-farm economic activity, AS is a natural starting point for expanding FAI reporting. Specifically, this project will provide the first estimates of the size of AS (number of establishments and workers), the wages paid to AS workers, the structure of AS firms, and the growth dynamics of AS establishments. Further, the algorithms, computer programs, data sets, and documentation developed in this project will be available to other researchers, serving as the foundation for subsequent work that examines FAI activity further along the food-and-fiber supply chain","The mission of the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) is to "". . provide timely, accurate, and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture."" It pursues this mission by reporting on the agricultural economy as represented by crop and animal production. The entire food-and-fiber supply chain--the set of activities that defines the full contribution of food and agriculture industries (FAI) to the economy involves a much wider range of economic activities, including manufacturing, transportation, wholesale and retail trade, and services.Presently, however, there is no coordinated systematic reporting on FAI in the United States. Off-farm economic activity is outside the current scope of NASS reporting responsibility, but as a result of technological change and evolution in industry structure, this is where much FAI activity lies. Without a clear mandate for reporting on food and agriculture more broadly, other federal statistical agencies (most prominently the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau) have had little reason to undertake the significant effort needed to report on off-farm FAI activity. Because an operational definition of FAI does not exist for reporting purposes, it is unknown how many establishments conduct business in the sector, how many workers these establishments employ, or how much these workers get paid. Failing to fully account for the contribution of FAI to the US economy can have important ramifications when setting policy and determining allocative priority. Answers to the many pressing public policy questions--allocating water rights, structuring crop insurance, negotiating trade agreements, reforming immigration policy, setting a minimum wage--demand quality data on the full range of FAI industries to assess the number of firms and workers that are potentially affected. And, with increasingly limited government resources, undercounting the number of businesses and jobs linked to agricultural production weakens the argument for funding to support research investigating the agricultural supply chain, the structure of agricultural production markets, and agricultural labor markets.In response to this significant data and research gap, this project is the first step in an ambitious long-run program to develop the methodologies, institutional partnerships, and research collaborations necessary for expanded federal statistical-agency reporting on FAI using existing data collected by the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service.Therefore, our long-run goals are to:(1) Identify FAI firms and establishments through administrative and survey data products published by the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service that are available in Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDC);(2) Develop a validated FAI data series that links establishments and firms through time, along with a repository of computer programs and documentation for use by qualified RDC researchers;(3) Measure the contribution of FAI to the economy of the United States, as well as at the regional, state, and local level;(4) Document the structure of establishment and firm organization in FAI and how it has changed over time;(5) Describe establishment-, firm-, and industry-level dynamics in FAI to document the sources of employment growth in the agricultural sector of the US economy;(6) Assess wage and productivity changes across time while taking full account of spatial and FAI sub-sectoral heterogeneity, and changes in FAI structure;(7) Work with the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis to develop a satellite account for official federal reporting on FAI.NAICS is a hierarchical system that categorizes 813,999 unique economic activities. In the 2012 edition, these activities are aggregated into 1,065 mutually exclusive six-digit industry codes. We have identified 168 industry categories that only include establishments engaged in activity associated with FAI. NASS reports on just 56 of these 168 six-digit industries. Further, there are a significant number of six-digit industries that include economic activity associated with the food and fiber supply chain, but are not exclusive to such activity. Classifying and validating the activity of firms across all of these sectors is well beyond the scope of the present project. Nevertheless, the proposed project provides a necessary and valuable first step in this process by generating algorithms, computer programs, data products, and documentation that will facilitate scaling-up in the future. At the same time, it will generate valuable new knowledge about an important subsector of FAI that has been previously understudied.Project ObjectivesThis proposal initiates work toward the long-term goals described above using a subset of FAI establishments and restricted-access data available to the PIs through an RDC project approved by the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service (TX1119). Specifically, the PIs have been granted access to the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSL), the Economic Census (EC), and the Services Annual Survey (SAS) from 1976 to the present. These data will be used to define and describe ""Agricultural Services"" defined as the set of establishments assigned to six-digit NAICS industries that include the following economic activities in their definition: support activities for crop or animal production, including veterinary services; wholesaling of raw agricultural products; agricultural equipment sales, leasing, rental, and repair; wholesale and retail trade of farm supplies; and local transportation of agricultural productsThe FAI industries falling under this definition share a common characteristic: they represent an important subset of economic activity linked to the farm-gate in the food-and-fiber supply chain. Because NASS undertakes data collection for on-farm economic activity, a reasonable starting point for expanding FAI reporting is moving outward from the farm in both directions along the supply chain. And while these industries do not account for all business activity directly linked to farm operation (farmers buy computers, take out loans, and hire accountants), the definition of AS employed here does capture an important part of the primary economic activities that either supply the immediate physical factors of production or receive the output. As a result, the empirical results generated as part of the project will readily complement those already produced by NASS.Therefore, we will initiate our long-run goals by utilizing establishment-level data from the LBD, SSL, EC, and SAS to achieve each the following project objectives:(1) Create a longitudinal dataset of establishments engaged in AS from 1976 to 2017 with validated records for entry year, exit year, industry code, employment, and payroll, along with documentation facilitating the use of this data by other RDC-qualified researchers to improve knowledge of FAI activity;(2) Calculate the number of establishments and workers engaged in AS at the national, regional, and state level;(3) Estimate the relationship between wages in the AS sector and associated establishment characteristics;(4) Describe firm structure in the AS sector, its evolution over time, and its effect on establishment characteristics and dynamics;(5) Describe the dynamics of establishment entry, growth, contraction, and exit in the AS sector.","agricultural services, consolidation, Longitudinal Business Database, firm dynamics"

Since a large proportion of the agricultural lands in the US is privately owned, a change in land use might sometimes come at the expense of profits from agriculture. Thus, regulatory agencies such as the USDA have implemented policies that compensate landowners for lost agricultural profits as well as reward them for being good environmental stewards. Examples of such policies include the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the Environmental Quality Incentives Program etc. A challenge with these policies however is that funds disbursal is subject to a budget constraint and often times landowners end up being compensated at rates much higher than what they would willingly accept to implement the land uses. Thus, the USDA has implemented reverse auctions (such as in the CRP) to combat this issue. However, over time, the cost-effectiveness of these auctions is found to be falling - given the funds, land use projects yielding the same amounts of conservation benefits becomes costlier to procure. This is a serious problem - given any future uncertainty about conservation budgets from which payments are to be made and the general importance associated with ecosystem services delivery from agricultural landscapes. Since these payments are an integral part of the agricultural system of the US, scientific investigation is important to identify auction design features which contribute positively to cost-effectiveness, while generating economic and environmental benefits for agricultural communities and society at large.This project will use economic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation auction policies under multiple conditions. Economic experiments involve real people making multiple choices on the basis of which they get paid. An analysis of the choices then yields insights about human behavior under multiple changing conditions. This project will focus on the impact of information about environmental impact of land use actions, auction format (and there can be many), social and community level ties and individuals&#39; tendencies to seek peer approval, on participation and bidding behavior. These experiments will be conducted with both university students and private landowners and will provide valuable insights about policy design and economic decision making by real people. The economic experiments will also serve as a means to engage university students and stakeholders in experiential learning providing them with a keener appreciation for human decision making in contexts relevant to their own lives.","The goal of this project is to inform the conservation auction policy-making effort by evaluating multiple economic auction designs to alter private landowners&#39; behavior and increase societal benefits from sustainable land-use decisions. Main objectives include:Using economic experiments with both students and stakeholders, we will determine how individuals behave in conservation auctions when facing conditions that approximate those faced by actual landowners.We will identify how information about the quality of conservation actions impacts auction performance under alternative bid formatsWe will study how the benefits of spatially-aggregated conservation affect auction performance under different spatial correlations of cost and quality and varying coordination among auction participantsConsider how the desire to avoid social disapproval affects auction performance when bidding outcomes are publicly announced and when the tradeoff between the private benefits of rent-seeking and the social benefits of public-good provision are made explicit in the auction context;Test how the strength of rural community ties can be used to improve the performance of conservation auctions.","ecosystem services, trust, Payment for Ecosystem Services Schemes, Public Goods, Spatial Targeting"
PROJECT,"UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC",1008628,2016-67013-24608,Growth and development of rhizomes,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,408000.0,"Paterson, AN, H.",ACTIVE,"This standard research proposal addresses molecular, cellular and whole-plant approaches to understanding how growth and development affect plant productivity. This research focuses on rhizomes, vegetative/reproductive structures that are a valuable asset in productivity of biomass, forage, and turfgrasses cultivated on &gt;60 million US acres and likely to increase. Rhizomes also enhance &#39;weediness&#39; of undesirable plants that infest millions of acres, reducing crop productivity and hindering utilization of potentially valuable genes in breeding. Information about rhizomatousness from botanical models extrapolates well. Relatives of sorghum, a model for rhizomatousness, will be studied. Comparative and association genetics will clarify the genetic control of rhizomatousness from Sorghum halepense, discern novel QTLs from those shared with S. propinquum, and investigate candidate genes by several approaches. Expression profiling during early stages of rhizome development and in genotypes with different QTLs for rhizomatousness will reveal gene networks, functional groups and specific genes associated with specific S. halepense QTLs for enhanced rhizomatousness. At the intersection of positional, expression, functional, comparative and association genetic evidence, a tractable number of candidate genes are expected to be strongly implicated in the genetic and developmental control of rhizome growth, perhaps initiating functional tests by means such as CRISPR/Cas genome editing. These approaches will also provide new information on genetic control of tillering, another important determinant of plant productivity. Findings are expected to advance knowledge toward development of novel methods to enhance productivity of desirable plants and control undesirable ones, also training young scientists in integrative contemporary approaches to addressing agricultural challenges.","Specific aims and our strategies to meet those aims are:Comparative and association genetics will clarify the genetic control of rhizomatousness derived from S. halepense, discern novel QTLs from those shared with S. propinquum, and investigate candidate genes with roles in both rhizomatousness and tillering.(a) Forward genetic analysis (QTL mapping) of both selfed and backcross progeny sets from a S. halepense x S. bicolor F1 cross will permit us to determine the inheritance of rhizomatousness from S. halepense; Tetraploid F1 progeny of S. halepense x S. bicolor crosses (based on unreduced S. bicolor gametes) have been selfed to generate F2 progeny and F2-derived F3 families; and also backcrossed to a tetraploidized S. bicolor to obtain BC1 and BC1-derived F2 families. Phenotyping of components of rhizomatousness using methods described (Paterson et al. 1995b) in replicated multi-year trials shows that it segregates widely in each of these populations with heritability ranging from 18-41% based on parent-progeny regression in different generations and environments (W. Kong &amp; A.P., in prep.). S. halepense and its derived progeny showed much more aggressive rhizomes than S. propinquum and derived progeny in side-by-side growouts. Enrichment of existing SSR data with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) will enable forward genetics (QTL mapping) methods pioneered by the PI (Paterson et al. 1988).(b) Comparing the &#39;genomic landscapes&#39; of QTLs for rhizomatousness from S. halepense and S. propinquum crossed to the same S. bicolor genotype will clarify genetic innovations that contribute to the enhanced rhizomatousness of S. halepense. Comparison of S. halepense x S. bicolor crosses to rich existing QTL data for progeny of a cross between the same S. bicolor strain [BTx623, from which the reference genome is derived (Paterson et al. 2009)] and its rhizomatous progenitor species, wild S. propinquum (Kong et al. 2013; Bowers et al. 2003; Lin et al. 1999; Paterson et al. 1995b; Paterson et al. 1995a; Lin et al. 1995) will help to reveal genetic novelty of S. halepense. By integrating such positional data with inferences about functional consequences of S. halepense specific mutations and expression data (Activity 2), we expect to identify genes that may have contributed to the much more extensive rhizome production of S. halepense than its rhizomatous progenitor (S. propinquum) that will be further investigated by in situ hybridization and may be attractive future candidates for Crispr/cas9 knockout.(c) Association genetics of tillering and its relationship with rhizomatousness. A developmental relationship between rhizome formation and tillering detailed above (Gizmawy et al. 1985) provides scope to employ association genetics to seek candidate genes. Tillering is an important element of plant productivity, considered to be among the most &#39;plastic&#39; of traits affecting biomass accumulation (Kim et al. 2010), with high-tillering advantageous when water is plentiful but imparting vulnerability in water-limited circumstances (Hammer et al. 2006). Tillering is more easily and precisely phenotyped than rhizomatousness, enjoys substantial published QTL data (already captured in our published QTL database resource (Zhang et al. 2013), and we have reported correspondence of some QTL locations for tillering and rhizomatousness (Paterson et al. 1995b; Kong et al. 2014). Tillering is more easily and more precisely phenotyped that rhizomatousness, is itself an important element of plant productivity, enjoys substantial published QTL data, and segregates widely in some intra-specific sorghum populations. Thus, in genomic regions where rhizome and tillering QTLs coincide closely, we will investigate non-random associations of variants in alleles or haplotypes with tillering measured among the members of an established diversity panel (Casa et al. 2008).Massively-parallel expression profiling (RNA-seq) during the earliest stages of rhizome development in genotypes with different sets of QTLs for rhizomatousness from S. halepense will reveal gene networks, functional groups and specific genes influenced by specific QTLs contributing to the enhanced rhizomatousness of S. halepense;Genetic analysis (Activity 1) will reveal the parental origins of QTL alleles in specific S. halepense-derived BC1F1/2 or F2/3 families, permitting us to identify genotypes that contain alternative alleles at QTLs of interest. By forming &#39;pools&#39; of such genotypes, we can &#39;homogenize&#39; alleles at other regions of the genome (Michelmore et al. 1991). Techniques developed in our prior funding period for precise isolation of growing points of incipient rhizomes by laser-microdissection (LM, see below) will be used to isolate and &#39;pool&#39; populations of mRNA from such contrasting groups of genotypes for massively parallel sequencing. Comparison of the transcriptome pools will seek evidence of corresponding striking differences in expression of specific genes. While finding a causal mutation by this approach is not impossible, realistically our goal here is to clarify cellular/developmental processes that are associated with specific genes (QTLs) conferring different degrees of development of rhizomes. This will complement and enhance results of our prior funding period in which we surveyed the entire transcriptome of S. halepense for differential gene expression related to rhizome growth.","comparative genomics, gene expression, laser capture microdissection, perennial, qtl, rhizome"

It is based on the fact that all insects require sterols, and that plant-feeding insects obtain sterols from their host plants. Exploiting this metabolic constraint offers a novel, target-specific and environmentally friendly approach for controlling insect herbivore pests. Our proposal takes two complementary directions. First, it examines how modifying a plant&#39;s sterol profile affects insect herbivores. Here we will measure caterpillar and aphid survival, growth, development and reproduction on Arabidopsis and tobacco plants that have atypical sterol profiles as a result of silencing a key enzyme in the plant sterol biosynthetic pathway. We will also examine insect performance on known Arabidopsis sterol mutants. Our second direction uses a Next-gen sequencing technology to identify genes in insects associated with modification of common plant sterols into cholesterol (the dominant insect tissue sterol, and the required precursor for molting hormone). We will do this using a caterpillar fed artificial diets containing different dietary sterols. Our results will: 1) demonstrate the potential of using plants with modified sterol profiles to control crop pests, and 2) identify insect genes that could be targets of RNAi techniques that would block insect herbivores ability to convert plant sterols to cholesterol, thereby suppressing their growth and reproduction.","The long-term goal motivating the current study is two-fold. First, we want to document how interfering with a plant&#39;s sterol biosynthetic pathway changes plant sterol profiles, both in terms of types and amounts of sterols present, and then develop agroeconomically transgenic plants that contain sterol profiles that can be used to manage insect herbivore pests. Second, we want to identify the insect genes involved in modifying plant sterols to cholesterol, and then develop transgenic plants that silence these genes, blocking the ability of insects to generate a sufficient amount of cholesterol that is needed to support survival, growth, and reproduction.This proposal has two key objectives. The first is to generate crop plants with atypical sterol profiles (predominantly ?8), using RNAi silencing approaches, and then examine insect performance on these lines. The second is to identify insect genes that play a critical role in modifying plant sterols into cholesterol. For each objective we will test a specific hypothesis.Hypothesis 1 (H1) - Insect survival, growth, development and fecundity decrease in a significant fashion on plants that produce high levels of delta8-sterols.Hypothesis 2 (H2) - Genes tied to sterol dealkylation are up regulated following the ingestion of phytosterols containing alkyl groups at the C24 position.These two hypotheses will be tested in two separate sets of experiments. The proposed project includes the development of new insights related to using plants with novel sterol profiles (generated using RNAi approaches) to negatively affect insect herbivores regardless of feeding style (chewer or sucker), and how these sterols are in turn metabolized in plant-feeding insects. This information will serve as the basis for the future application of using sterol nutritional requirements and constraints as a novel and potentially powerful approach to manage insect herbivore pests in agricultural systems.","Cholesterol, Next-Gen sequencing, RNAi, cholesterol, insect-plant interactions, rnai, sterols, Insect-Plant Interactions, Next-gen sequencing, Sterol Metabolism, Sterols"
PROJECT,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,1008654,2016-67013-24746,Flavonoid Regulation of Root Architecture in Tomato,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,408000.0,"Muday, GL.",ACTIVE,"Flavonoids are ubiquitous plant metabolites whose health promoting activities have made them a target to improve the nutritional quality of crops. These specialized metabolites are potent antioxidants with demonstrated ability to reduce the growth of tumors in animal models. These molecules also function to control plant growth and development and the response of plants to environmental stress. In particular, tomato genotypes with reduced ability to synthesize flavonoid metabolites have a substantial reduction in the degree of root branching, while genotypes with elevated levels of pathway metabolites exhibit enhanced root branching. As extensive branching of roots enhances ability of plants to absorb nutrients and water, an important goal of this project is to identify genes and metabolites that enhance root branching. This project applies genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical approaches to examine and manipulate the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato).We will utilize two collections of tomatoes: mutants with altered synthesis of flavonoid biosynthesis, isolated because of altered levels of anthocyanins (visible downstream metabolites), and introgression lines resulting from crosses between cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) and a wild drought tolerant relative (S. pennelli). These genotypes will be used to understand how flavonoid metabolites modulate root growth and development and the productivity of plants with altered pathway activity. Biochemical analysis of flavonoid metabolite accumulation profiles will be integrated with expression of genes encoding pathway enzymes and regulatory transcription factors to predict the genetic defects that cause these metabolic alterations. We will sequence candidate genes and also selectively employ genome resequencing to identify mutations that lead to altered flavonoid accumulation. This genetic and biochemical insight will be overlaid on characterization of root development to link specific flavonoid metabolites to altered root architecture and subsequent effects on yield and seed set in field-grown plants. We will ask whether flavonoid levels are modulated by the gaseous plant hormone, ethylene, and how flavonoids and ethylene interact to control root development. These experiments will provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms that control synthesis of these nutritionally beneficial molecules, develop new tomato varieties with enhanced levels of these molecules, and determine how flavonoids modulate growth and development of this important crop species.","A major goal of this project is to identify genetic controls of root architecture, since a highly branched root system enhances both moisture and nutrient uptake promoting crop plant productivity. This project will identify genes that modulate root architecture using introgression lines in which domesticated tomato (Solanum lycoperiscum) is crossed with a native drought resistant relative S. pennelli and using mutants with altered metabolism. Specifically, we have in hand mutants with altered levels of specialized metabolites called flavonoids, which we have used to illustrate that flavonoids have a positive effect on root formation in tomato, yet additional mutants are needed to identify which intermediates in this biochemical pathway are the active molecule in modulating root development. For many of these mutants, the genetic changes that lead to altered synthesis of these flavonoid metabolites are not known. A second goal of this project is to identify the metabolite profiles and genetic changes in these anthocyanin mutants to provide insight into this biochemical pathway in tomato, and to ask how altered suites of these metabolites affect root development. We will also examine flavonoid accumulation profiles in the introgression lines to provide additional insight into the genetic regulation of this biosynthetic pathway. Our final goal is to explore the hormonal controls of flavonoid synthesis to ask if ethylene controls root architecture by modulating the accumulation of these metabolites.Research Aims:1. Combine flavonoid metabolite and transcript accumulation profiles with genome resequencing to identify the genetic and biochemical defects in anthocyanin mutants and how the altered metabolism influences root architecture. 2. Characterize flavonoid metabolites and root development across a population of tomato introgression lines to identify genomic regions that modulate these processes and identify the mechanisms that lead to these biochemical and developmental changes.3. Examine the regulation of flavonoid synthesis by ethylene and the developmental impacts of this regulation on root architecture.","anthocyanin, ethylene, flavonoid, lateral root, root, tomato"

The Agriculture Research magazine has recently referred to Physaria fendleri (aka lesquerella) as a ""Cinderella crop"" because its oil, rich in hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), could be industrially used for the manufacture of cosmetics, lubricant greases, coatings, plastics, paints, biofuels, etc. The HFAs currently used in industry are extracted from imported castor which also contains highly toxic compounds such as ricin and ricinin. Free of toxins, Physaria represents a promising alternative to imported castor oil, and is hence in the verge of commercialization. Moreover, Physaria has tremendous potentials for oil production, has a short maturity time and is not used for food compared to other oilseed crops. However, to turn this plant into a viable alternative crop, the accumulation of HFAs must be improved. Although HFA production could theoretically be enhanced by classical breeding or genetic engineering approaches, a lack of knowledge of the metabolic pathways underlying unusual fatty acid synthesis in Physaria seeds presents a major constraint. This is a major knowledge gap that this project intends to fill. For this purpose, Physaria embryos will be grown in culture conditions that mimic their development in planta, in presence of various labeled substrates. The labeling will be followed in intracellular compounds and the flow of carbon will be determined in central metabolic pathways as well as in triacylglycerol assembly. Carbon fluxes will be compared with pre-existing metabolite and transcript levels in order to identify potential limiting steps in the synthesis and accumulation of HFAs. These bottlenecks will serve as biomarkers and targets to guide future breeding and metabolic engineering strategies with the aim of improving HFA production in Physaria.","The major goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how industrially relevant hydroxy fatty acids are synthesized in an emerging crop Physaria fendleri. The specific objectives are three-fold:We will build a map of carbon partitioning in Physaria embryos to identify potential bottlenecks (i.e reactions or pathways) that are limiting the provision of carbon, reductant, and energy required for fatty acid synthesis.We will elucidate the metabolic pathway of the lipid biosynthetic network that promote and/or limit the accumulation of unusual-fatty-acid-containing triacylglycerol (TAG) in Physaria embryos.We will compare these data with pre-existing metabolite and transcript levels in Physaria to identify potential gene targets for future metabolic engineering and biomarkers for breeding.",hydroxy fatty acids; Physaria fendleri; metabolic flux analysis; triacyl glycerol assembly
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,1008736,2016-67023-24757,Targeted Conservation Contracts to Enhance Agricultural Best Management Practices: Incorporating Heterogeneity and Predicting Additionality,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,498434.0,"Duke, JO, M.",ACTIVE,"The U.S. spends billions on state and federal policies encouraging farmers to implement best management practices through conservation contracts. Best management practices programs seek agricultural objectives, such as increasing crop prices by reducing production, and environmental objectives, such as providing wildlife habitat and protecting water quality. Governments use best management practice contracts to pay for environmental services with easements that secure alternate land uses (e.g., conversion of riparian farmlands to buffers or low-lying lands to wetlands) or payments for altered land management (e.g., no-till farming, water control structures, or cover crops). Policy that keeps soil and nutrients on farms and out of U.S. waters helps maximize agricultural productivity while promoting environmental quality for rural communities and the U.S. as a whole. A vibrant area of social science research explains best management practice adoption, largely as a function of monetary payments and farmer characteristics. Yet existing research provides little insight on the design of more flexible best management practice contracts that capitalize on farmer differences and desires to enhance cost-efficiency and agri-environmental outcomes.The proposed project extends existing research to study a single best management practice, cover crops, in terms of flexibility, adoption, and enhanced efficiency. Scientific evidence shows that cover crops provide substantial public (i.e., off-farm or external benefits). For example, cover crops: reduce nutrient losses to ground and surface water; decrease erosion; and reduce the need for fertilizer, pesticides, and/or herbicides. However, evidence also suggests that current cover crop programs are not designed optimally to reflect farmers&#39; adoption preferences and, in many states, cover crop adoption rates are low. Empirical research finds that farmers do not adopt cover crops due to initial net costs, a lack of awareness, agronomic issues, lack of a state program, low program funding, and/or program inflexibility. Agronomic reasons include farmers&#39; perceived lack of erosion problems, incompatibility with no-till, timing that conflicts with planting or harvest, difficulty in handling cover crop residue, and equipment/input requirements. Economic factors affecting cover crop adoption include farm income and farm size. Researchers suggest that farmers need better information about cover crop management, including seed varieties, nutrient benefits, and policy incentives. Contract inflexibility also limits adoption of cover crops through cost-share programs. Despite this increasing body of evidence, no work evaluates how program design can be improved to maximize net adoption, reflecting preferences of this type--and in particular how farmers trade-off program attributes when making adoption choices. The goal of the proposed work is to develop coordinated models of cover crop adoption that provide heretofore-unavailable insight to enhance program efficacy.This principal innovation of the proposed research is to collect new data that coordinates three strands of conservation policy analysis: adoption behavior, alternative policy design, and information problems. Data will be collected using two types of cover-crop adoption surveys and observational data about how farmers actually plant cover crops. These data are combined into validated models of behavior. The proposed models are flexible in that they can help researchers and governmental agencies understand how to best design cover crop policies that match farmers&#39; desires and constraints. The proposed work benefits the research community by creating new knowledge on conservation contracts and testing new methods. The public will benefit directly from the testing and design of targeted, optimal conservation contracts that address farmer needs, providing agencies the information necessary to motivate and design more cost-effective policy. For example, policymakers can use the results directly to predict cover crop adoption under alternative flexibility designs, controlling for demographic and land characteristics--and thereby save taxpayer money while achieving more benefits. The inclusion of farmer and field characteristics in the model will enable results to be adapted to regions outside the immediate case study area. This will enable forecasting of optimal acreage adoption for any budget level and to overcome predictable policy failures. In states seeking to comply with total maximum daily loads (such as the Chesapeake Bay states), this tool allows estimation of the change in cover crop acreage and nutrient removal for a given expenditure. This, in turn, could be used to support the Watershed Implementation Plans required by EPA. Cover crops provide the application setting, but the approach adapts to most other best management practice policies, providing a wholesale reexamination of the way agri-environmental policies are designed.","The overall goal of this project is to improve the cost-effectiveness of policies used to promote best management practices on farms in the United States. The research will inform the development of targeted, more cost effective conservation contracts that can be used by governmental agencies to incentivize agricultural best management practices. It will produce information to enable the design of flexible conservation contracts that can be used to optimize environmental benefits, farmer adoption, or acres enrolled. These innovative contracts will help U.S. agriculture remain competitive while balancing production and sustainable agri-environmental benefits.The targeted conservation contracts will be derived from a specially designed survey of farmer preferences with respect to one best management practice--cover crops--as a case study. A series of surveys and actual planting decisions will be combined to derive a model of farmer participation and preferences. There are six research objectives. First, the researchers will develop revealed/stated preference models of cover crop program flexibility/adoption to provide insight into relationships between program design and farmers&#39; decision-making. Second, the researchers will design and implement innovative preference models to estimate tradeoffs among conservation contract attributes for different types of farmers across multiple regions in two states. Third, the researchers will characterize current cover crop patterns by coordinating cover crop adoption data from government programs, observational data (transect survey), and an adoption survey. Fourth, the researchers will validate (using collected transect survey and linked cover crop adoption data) and apply the revealed/stated preference model to forecast cover crop adoption and land cover change under innovative contract designs. Fifth, the researchers will compare contract fiscal efficiency under various conditions and developing an additionality analysis to control for enrolled land planted in cover crop regardless of contracts. Additionality occurs when policy incentivizes adoption that farmers would not otherwise provide. Sixth, the researchers will design targeted cover crop contracts that account for farmers&#39; tradeoffs, additionality, and fiscal inefficiency to inform more optimal and cost-effective conservation contract designs. This project directly responds to USDA goals by focusing research at the nexus of agricultural land use, management, and conservation, and providing methodological advances to inform incentive-based polices and improve agricultural profitability.","conservation, land"

With the evolution of intensified swine production, there has also been increased opportunity for pathogen exposure and spread. With this in mind, much attention has been given to diagnostics, immunology, epidemiology and surveillance for pathogens such as Porcine Endemic Diarrhea (PED) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) viruses. However, surprisingly little is known about how viruses and other pathogens antagonize efficiency of growth in pigs. In particular, the latest edition of the Nutrient Requirements of Swine guidelines states that more information and research is needed to address how health impacts nutrient (i.e. amino acids) utilization and requirements for growingswine. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve delivery and availability of nutrients and energy to immunologically challenged pigs in order to obtain higher efficiency of lean tissue production and wellbeing. Achieving this goal will reduce production and efficiency losses due to disease challenges. This proposal also strengthens collaboration efforts of a strong research group focused on understanding and improving efficient meat animal production.Using two very common swine enteric and respiratory pathogens (PEDV and PRRSV, respectively), the proposed experiments will also adopt classical amino acid digestibility approaches to address industry and National Research Council nutrient requirement knowledge gaps for health challenged pigs. Additionally, novel cellular, genomic and proteomic approaches to define pathway shifts in tissue and mitochondrial metabolism that relate to homeostatic and homeorhetic regulation under a disease challenge. We expect that both the enteric and respiratory challenges to increase mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that could explain decreases in lean tissue accretion and increased skeletal muscle rotein degradation. Realization of these results will provide critical new knowledge relating immune function to digestion and metabolism in lean tissue. These result will help give rise to metabolism targeted interventions and better dietary strategies for health challenged pigs to mitigate losses in growth rates and feed efficiencyto enhance global food security and sustainability.

An Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) system has been demonstrated to measure multiple elements in the field over large volumes of soil compared with competing techniques. INS is a gamma-ray spectroscopic technique that can detect multiple elements simultaneously. In this effort, we will focus on improving the detection capabilities of the system and adding on-board GPS capabilities to the system. Additional gamma-ray detectors will be added to increase the counting rate which will improve the minimum detection limit, minimum detection change and sensitivity of the system. GPS capabilities will be integrated into the INS platform and merged with the INS spectrum. Soil carbon content will be used to characterize the performance gains that are achieved through these engineering changes. The modified system will be field test on three different land use cases: pasture, row crop, and forest. The results of this effort will enable the generation of high resolution maps of soil total carbon stores with greater spatial and temporal resolution than is currently economically feasible. ","The acceptance and adoption of different agricultural land-use practices that mitigate and adapt to climate change depends on the productivity and profitability of the agricultural operations. Accurate and precise measurement and mapping of natural and anthropogenic variations in soil carbon stores is a critical component of the evaluation process. Traditional methods to determine carbon content (e.g. dry combustion) are time consuming and labor intensive since they require collecting core samples in the field, complex sample preparation, and analyzing them in a laboratory. The information gained from soil analysis by these methods represents a point measurement in space and time that poses a problem when extrapolating to fields at the landscape, regional, or a higher level - limiting its utility for long time scales and expansive coverage. These methods are impractical to use to measure small changes over time in response to land use or production practices. A novel method, Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS), has been demonstrated to provide wide-area monitoring over prolonged periods in a simple manner. The INS system is non-destructive and analyzes large volumes in static-modes and large fields in scanning-modes of operation. A unique capability of the INS system is its ability to scan arbitrarily large areas, providing a single mean value for carbon content over the entirety of the area. The INS system is capable of multielement analysis since the gamma-rays emitted by the soil elements occur at characteristic energies.The overall hypothesis is that INS technology can effectively provide total carbon measurement capabilities for near surface monitoring over wide areas and over long time scales with better precision, sensitivity, and granularity than other competing techniques. The overall goal is to improve the capabilities of the current INS system and validate its usage for monitoring changes in soil carbon as a result of land use and management practices. The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) improve the performance and capabilities of the current INS system through engineering design changes; 2) calibrate and validate the improved system over different soil types and land use conditions; and 3) optimize and characterize the performance of the improved system.","INS, Inelastic Neutron Scattering, carbon, precision agriculture, soils"

Discolored beef cuts are often sold at discounted prices or ground to lower-value products such as ground beef, and if discoloration is extensive the products are discarded. All these retail practices lead to revenue loss, which is estimated to be more than $1 billion annually in the U.S. retail beef industry. Beef color stability is governed by the interactions between small biomolecules and myoglobin. Recent studies suggested possible relationships between phosphorylation of muscle proteins and meat quality. However, no investigations were undertaken to characterize phosphorylation in myoglobin and its impact on fresh meat color stability. Characterizing the biochemistry of phosphorylation in beef myoglobin will elucidate the impact of this post-translational modification on beef color stability. This also will aid developing novel processing strategies to minimize discoloration and to improve marketability of fresh beef.","Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification of proteins, and protein phosphorylation is a key regulator of biological processes. Preliminary data suggested that beef myoglobin undergoes phosphorylation in post-mortem Longissimus lumborum muscle and that myoglobin phosphorylation compromises retail color stability, which is a major trait influencing consumers&#39; purchase decisions. However, investigations were not undertaken to characterize the biochemistry of phosphorylation in myoglobin and its impact on fresh meat color stability. Therefore, the objectives of this project are: (1) To identify the sites of myoglobin phosphorylation in post-mortem beef Longissimus lumborum muscle; (2) To determine how post-mortem aging influences phosphorylation in beef myoglobin; and (3) To characterize the relationship between myoglobin phosphorylation and beef color stability.",Beef color; Longissimus lumborum; Myoglobin; Protein phosphorylation

In livestock, low birth weight significantly increases the risk for mortality and morbidity prior to weaning. Each year, the livestock industry loses 8-12% of its offspring to low birth weight caused by fetal growth restriction. Metabolic complications due to fetal growth restriction persist in animals that survive weannig, which slows growth and lowers meat quality, reducing producer revenue.As postnatal growth is largely dependent upon fetal growth and development, it is important to determine how management decisions could impact the growth trajectory of the fetus; however, it is not always feasible to prevent fetal growth restriction in production settings. Thus, our proposal focuses on identifying the mechanism that regulates skeletal muscle growth and metabolism that is altered by fetal stress due to fetal growth restriction. To test our hypothesis we will use a well-defined heat stress model of fetal growth restriction in sheep that shares the same physiological abnormalities as seen in other livestock species with this condition. This model has the advantage to allow us to control and quantify maternal, fetal, and neonatal conditions offering a tremendous opportunity to study muscle growth and metabolic adaptations and to test possible interventions for improvement. By confirming our hypothesis, we will define a novel mechanism that explains how fetal stress during growth restriction in utero is associated with postnatal metabolic dysfunction and growth deficiencies which are known to limit livestock production. This project will provide the foundation for potential interventions aimed at improving growth and metabolic outcomes in low birth weight offspring.","Our long term goal is to understand how placental insufficiency induced-intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) impacts skeletal muscle growth and metabolism and develop new knowledge that leads to a targeted strategy to increase growth efficiency and carcass quality in meat producing animals born under their optimal weight. The objectives are: (1)Determine satellite cell proliferation rate, fiber diameter, and phenotype of skeletal muscle from IUGR lambs.(2) Determine the phosphorylation state of insulin signaling molecules in isolated myofibers exposed to stimulatory insulin concentrations.","catecholamines, insulin sensitivity, intrauterine growth restriction, skeletal muscle"

But parasites, including the globally distributed Crithidia bombi, have contributed to US bumblebee population decreases of up to 96%.Nectar consumed by bees contains antimicrobial phytochemicals that may be medicinal for parasitized pollinators, suggesting that floral resources could protect bees from infection. In our lab, 4 nectar phytochemicals reduced parasitism in C. bombi-infected bumblebees. Surprisingly, these putatively medicinal phytochemicals had different effects on 2 other C. bombi strains, implying that strains vary in phytochemical resistance and floral landscapes could select for resistance.Predicting the strength and duration of phytochemical effects on pollinator parasitism requires empirical tests of inter-strain differences and evolution of phytochemical resistance. This project will elucidate direct effects of phytochemicals on C. bombi cell cultures to determine:(1) Do strains vary in resistance to phytochemicals?

Most of the physical protection of soil carbon occurs at small scale within chunks of soil known as soil aggregates. However, it is very difficult to learn about the processes that go on at that scaleas most modern techniques are destructive, allowing for only one type of analysis per aggregate, which are known to be highly variable. Through the use of computed micro-tomography, a technique similar to a medical CT scan, images of the soil aggregates can be obtained while preserving the aggregates for other destructive analysis, in this case, stable carbon isotope analysis.By taking advantage ofthe natural isotope signature difference between corn and annual rye grass in conjunction with computed micro-tomography images, this research will further the understanding of how soil aggregates physicallyprotect soil carbon as it relates to aggregate pores and pore structure when farmers utilize cover crops.

Instead, engineers rely on a prototype-building and field-testing cycle, which is slow, costly, and cannot explore the above-mentioned interactions.Our goal is to build and validate an open-source design tool that integrates mechanical simulation with validated models of fruit-bearing orchard trees, in order to evaluate the fruit picking productivity of selective fruit picking systems. In support of this goal, a library of agronomically correct geometric models of ready-to-harvest fruit-bearing trees will be generated, based on data from extensive digitization of tree shapes and fruit positions in commercial orchards. This library will be used to create virtual orchards within a customized open-source robotics simulator. The predictive power of the developed tool will be evaluated by simulating and executing harvesting using a two-arm robot on a mobile platform, and by comparing the predicted and achieved productivities under controlled conditions. The simulator will also be used to calculate the optimal design parameters that maximize the productivity of a conceptual robotic harvester with several actuated arms, operating on alternative tree architectures.The proposed open-source design tool is expected to accelerate the development of novel orchard mechanized harvesting systems.

The productivity metrics that will be computed will be fruit picking efficiency, throughput, and size. The first two metrics have been identified as the most important variables (along with purchase price) that define harvest cost. The third metric relates to quality and expected economic return. All metrics are strongly coupled to machine design and can be used to guide it. Actually, quantitative evaluation of machine productivity could be also used to evaluate alternative orchard layouts and tree training systems.Objective 1. Orchard modelingThis objective aims at removing the main obstacle in model-based design of tree-fruit harvesting systems.

PROJECT,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,1008511,2016-67023-24904,"Geospatial Tools And Analyses To Assess, Educate And Inform Spatial Dimensions Of Rural Food Insecurity",National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,417942.0,"Mulrooney, TI, JO.",ACTIVE,"Food insecurity is a general and growing concern in the U.S.; in 2012, 14.5 percent of US households were food insecure (USDA Research, 2013), with North Carolina ranking 5th among the 10 states exhibiting significantly higher household food insecurity rates than the national average (Gunderson et al. 2013). In particular, rural food insecurity is a significant but understudied problem in the U. S. The extent and distribution of food insecure rural residents has not been well-mapped, and little work has been done on the identification of logistically and economically feasible strategies for increased access to healthy food in rural communities. Emergency food providers have taken steps to meet the rural service gap, but distributing food from food banks and food pantries to the neediest in rural areas has proven to be highly problematic (Molnar et al. 2001; Bitto et al. 2003). An important barrier to success is the lack of information about food access in rural area.Decision tools for researchers, farm markets and market systems using ever-evolving GIS technologies serves as a new approach to quantify the many facets that encompass rural food insecurity and ways to address these challenges. A Geographic Information System (GIS) serves as the means by which spatially related phenomena can be created, analyzed and rendered in the digital environment. All 100 North Carolina counties, as well as municipalities and private contractors require the use of GIS personnel, ranging in fields from land assessment, banking and zoning to environmental monitoring, school districting, crime analysis, economic analysis and sociology. Experience and skills in GIS acquired during undergraduate and graduate studies are broadly applicable in diverse fields, including health science, sustainability, sociology, demography, economics/business, transportation and allied STEM fields such as computer science, information systems and environmental science. Integrating STEM technologies with intervention planning has the potential to be a cost-effective means for assistance organizations to conduct effective planning aimed at understanding and ultimatelyimproving food and nutritional security in rural communities.","The overarching goal of this Integrated Research project is to develop a more nuanced understanding of rural food insecurity through the use of geospatial tools, and to apply the lessons learned to facilitate practical interventions aimed at reducing rural food insecurity. The specific focus of our work will be on the collection, integration, analysis and assessment of geospatial data that is of a type and level of detail to be of practical value in the development, implementation and evaluation of interventions addressing rural food insecurity. In the course of this research, we will (1) provide formal and informal training to HBCU students in the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to address complex societal challenges; (2) conduct generalizable research on the metrics used to assess food availability, accessibility and utilization, and on the various factors that contribute to food insecurity; and (3) develop an outreach program to inform and support food assistance organizations in applying GIS tools to cost-effectively serve food-insecure rural communities and to help farmers connect with underserved rural markets. In doing this, we will explore cost-effective methods for needs assessment that take into account both causal complexity and programmatic challenges imposed by the combination of limited resources and increased demand. Integrating STEM technologies with intervention planning has the potential to be a cost-effective means for assistance organizations to conduct effective planning aimed at improving food and nutritional security in rural communities. A majority of this work will be done by a minority-serving institution and provide education, research and outreach opportunities not only to students, but also faculty and the surrounding community.This work addresses a very pressing need: researchers and food assistance providers do not currently have sufficient information about the extent and causes of rural food insecurity to plan interventions. Although there is clear evidence that rural food insecurity is a problem in rural America, with rural food insecurity higher than the national average (Nord 2002; Bitto et al. 2003), the extent and severity of the problem is unclear. Relatively little is known about the validity and local applicability of sometimes contradictory research findings and derived assumptions regarding factors thought to influence rural food and nutritional insecurity at the household level. These knowledge gaps hinder efforts to improve food security; the effectiveness of direct food security interventions depends on accurate targeting of the vulnerable subpopulation(s) and of the causes of insecurity (Barrett 2010). A particular challenge in developing practical tools that can assist in the design of effective interventions is selection of criteria and weighting factors that provide useful insights into real and significant causal relationships.Specific supporting objectives of our proposed Integrated Research include:1. Provide resources for the development, use and validation of high-quality geospatial data used as part of this research and outreach project.2. Develop GIS-based tools and assessment strategies to explore the physical, environmental and human geography of rural food insecurity and to provide information that is useful to food researchers in explaining these patterns and to assistance providers in developing effective place-based food and nutritional interventions.3. Identify rural subpopulations at high risk of food insecurity and the most important contributing factors. These subpopulations will be primary targets for future interventions.4. Map the distribution of target subpopulations and identify geographic areas that have the greatest need of food assistance based on the various dimensions of food insecurity to identify high-priority locations for initial intervention design and piloting efforts.5. Develop methods that enable food assistance providers to prospectively predict and retrospectively assess the impact of food security intervenations. 6. Based ona case study, develop generally applicable tools and guidelines that assistance organizations can use in planning practical and effective interventions to address rural food insecurity in the U.S.7. Disseminate these findings, data and techniques to a larger audience so that they can be applied in other rural areas in the U.S.8. Provide education resources, both formal (classroom and tutorial) and informal (workshop, support and outreach) to students, faculty and the community about the use and application of geospatial technologies to the study of rural food insecurity.","food availability, gis, mapping, stem, Geospatial Research, Rural Food Insecurity"

To reverse these public health challenges, the food environment must provide opportunities for healthy eating at affordable prices. The food environment challenges identified in urban, non-Native communities, are likely different from those faced on the Navajo Nation.Convenience stores are the food outlets closest to Navajo communities, yet they have few healthy options. Little is known about the challenges to supplying healthy food on the Navajo Nation. Designed to complement and inform a CDC Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) grant, the goal of this project is to better understand constraints, across the supply chain, and of shoppers, that make purchasing fresh produce at small stores on the Navajo Nation challenging.The following objectives will be met: 1) determine food supply chain complexities on the Navajo Nation; 2) determine Navajo food shopper preferences towards buying produce at local small stores; and 3) evaluate the role that store ownership structure plays in the amount of fresh produce offered by small stores on Navajo Nation. This mixed-methods study partners with local communities and uses interviews, intercept surveys and store inventory data to inform REACH interventions and provide insight applicable to other rural and Native areas working to change the food environment.","LONG TERM GOAL: Improve access to healthy, affordable foods within smaller retail food outlets operating on the Navajo Nation.PROJECT GOAL: Improve our understanding of the constraints in the supply chain and for shoppers that impede purchasing fresh produce at small retail food outlets on the Navajo Nation.OBJECTIVES: To meet the above goals, the following three objectives will be addressed:1) Determine food supply chain complexities to offering fresh produce on the Navajo NationA common public health intervention focused in small stores is increasing the availability of healthy foods. However, few studies have documented the food system challenges underlying that lack of availability, and none have done so within small stores on the Navajo Nation. Formative research with a small sample of Navajo store-owners identified many challenges faced in working with suppliers and distributors to source healthy foods including limited offerings of suppliers. This study objective fills an unmet need necessary for understanding and changing the food environment on the Navajo Nation and thus will contribute to childhood obesity prevention efforts. Sub-objective 1.1 Document the challenges that prevent supply of affordable, fresh produce to Navajo small stores. Sub-objective 1.2 Determine potential for stores or other informal-markets to source produce from Navajo farmers.2) Determine Navajo food shopper preferences towards buying fresh produce at small stores on Navajo NationA community food assessment we conducted with 250 people on the eastern side of the Navajo Nation revealed that a majority of participants feel the healthy food they want to eat is unavailable close to home. More than half traveled over one hour to shop for food. Additionally, formative research conducted with a small sample of store owners on the Navajo Nation documented their willingness to supply healthy options if the demand existed. However, no research has been done to understand the food preferences and attitudes towards purchasing fresh produce at small stores on the Navajo Nation. Completion of this objective will provide an avenue through which shoppers can have a collective voice into the future of product availability, and it will give the CDC REACH grant (to which this dissertation contributes) critical information for tailoring store intervention strategies. The decisions made while food shopping dictate the quality of the home food environment and also have direct impacts on childhood diet and weight gain. Thus, understanding food shopping preferences is critical to enhancing childhood obesity prevention efforts. Sub-objective 2.1 Determine the extent to which the number of produce types at small stores impacts the likelihood of purchasing of that produce.3) Evaluate the role that store ownership structure plays in the amount of fresh produce offered by small stores on Navajo NationThere are three distinct ownership structures of small stores on Navajo Nation: independently owned stores (such as trading posts); Navajo Nation chain stores (such as Navajo Petroleum and the Red Mesa Express chain) and National/International chain stores (such as Chevron or Shell). During informal conversations with store managers at these three types of stores, it has become clear that the level of autonomous decision-making among the different store owners (or managers) has strong impacts on the type of foods offered. Informed by our team&#39;s collective experience, we hypothesize that there is a significant difference in fresh produce availability across the three different types of stores. Understanding this relationship quantitatively will inform future store intervention work and also will provide avenues through which alternative supply chain development might be possible (e.g., multiple stores purchasing collectively from one supplier to increase volume delivered and decrease price for shoppers).BACKGROUND: In New Mexico, American Indians have the highest rates of childhood obesity of all ethnic groups; 19 percent of American Indian youth were obese in 2011, compared to 9 percent of Caucasian youth. Childhood obesity has both immediate and long-term health effects, with American Indians and Alaska Natives experiencing the greatest health disparities related to obesity and concomitant chronic diseases among all US racial and ethnic minorities. The Navajo Nation, situated in rural and arid Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, has about 250,000 members living on 27,000 square miles. Over half of Navajo residents live below the poverty line, 42% are unemployed and one-third lack plumbing and electricity. Navajo face a double burden; they have high rates of chronic disease while also having the highest prevalence of food insecurity reported for a US population. Despite community interest in bringing back traditional farming, farm-to-table initiatives are in nascent phases. According to the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, all Navajo Nation census tracts are ""food deserts."" They are all low income, where a significant number of households either have low access to a vehicle or live 20 or more miles from the nearest supermarket. Our preliminary research has shown that residents in many parts of Navajo travel more than one hour for their food shopping. Convenience stores, gas stations and trading posts are the food outlets in closest proximity to Navajo communities, yet food environment research conducted by a CDC/Navajo Division of Health collaboration showed that there are fewer healthy options, less fresh produce, and higher prices in these stores compared to the thirteen grocery stores on the Navajo Nation. Financial and infrastructure constraints and few trips per month off the Reservation result in diets primarily of shelf-stable foods. Diets for individuals are influenced by multiple and complex factors. However, research shows that the food environment contributes to the obesity epidemic over and above individual factors such as knowledge and skills. To reverse the obesity epidemic, the food environment must provide opportunities for healthy eating at affordable prices.","childhood obesity, farming, food system, native american, small stores"

This project aims to understand the regulation of aflatoxin production and the role of aflatoxin in the ecology of the fungi that produce it. The current bias in agriculture is to view fungal toxins in terms of their toxigenicity to humans and livestock. However, the perspective in this project is that these toxins evolved to benefit the fungi that produce them, not to be toxic to humans. The effects of aflatoxin on fungal ecology are largely unknown. If we could understand how these toxins affect the biology and ecology of the most important fungus that produces aflatoxin, Aspergillus flavus, we have a greater potential for combating toxin-producing molds before they contaminate food supplies with aflatoxin. For example, biological control of A. flavus using strains of the same fungus that do not produce aflatoxin is a potential strategy for combating aflatoxin contamination. We will determine how aflatoxin affects the growth and survival of these fungi under a variety of environmental conditions to determine how aflatoxin benefits the fungus. Therefore, the results of this project may help in designing and implementing optimal biocontrol strategies based on maximizing the fitness of nontoxigenic strains.

They provide precursors for vitamin A synthesis and antioxidants against the incidence of certain chronic diseases. Despite of the significant progress in our understanding of carotenoid metabolism in plants, the overall control mechanism remains largely unknown, which limits our ability to improve carotenoid content in food crops. Chromoplasts are special plant organelles that possess superior ability to synthesize and stably store massive amounts of carotenoids. However, virtually nothing is known about how chromoplasts are formed. We has uncovered the only known protein, OR, that governs chromoplast formation in plants. Thus, OR is a key to uncover how chromoplasts are formed in plants. Excitedly, several proteins in the plastid protein-import pathway were recently identified and verified as true OR-interacting partners. The proposed research will use interdisciplinary approaches to test the overall hypothesis that chromoplast biogenesis is governed by OR via directly regulating components in the plastid protein-import pathway to facilitate chromoplast preprotein import and/or plastid membrane proliferation. This research is expected to unravel new players in the chromoplast biogenesis pathway and provide novel mechanistic insights to advance our fundamental understanding of chromoplast formation and carotenoid accumulation in plants. Development of carotenoid-enriched plant foods is the most effective approach to maximize the nutritional and health benefits of carotenoids in our diet. Our research will provide the basic scientific knowledge and the genetic tools for such endeavor.

However, the intriguing molecular mechanisms underlying chromoplast biogenesis remain an enigma.The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that chromoplast biogenesis is mediated by OR via regulating proteins in the plastid protein import pathway. Three specific objectives are proposed here: 1) to biochemically and genetically analyze the interactions and involvement of the plastid protein import machinery proteins in chromoplast biogenesis and carotenoid accumulation; 2) to determine the mechanisms by which OR mediates chromoplast biogenesis; and 3) to identify additional components in the chromoplast biogenesis pathway.","carotenoids, OR protein, chromoplast biogenesis, plastid protein-import pathway"
PROJECT,SAES - OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,1008573,2016-67013-24736,Resistance Genes that Confer Plant Disease Susceptibility and Their Activation,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,498780.0,"Wolpert, TH, J.",ACTIVE,"This project involves the study of a disease called Victoria blight which was originally identified on the host plant, oats. The disease is caused by the fungus, Cochliobolus victoriae which can only infect oats if it makes a peptide called ""victorin"" and interacts with oats carrying a gene called ""Vb"". Various analyses suggest that the Vb gene, which confers Victoria blight susceptibility and sensitivity to victorin, is identical to a gene called Pc2 which confers resistance to a different disease called ""crown rust of oats"" caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata. Consistent with this interpretation, molecular analyses reveal that victorin activates a resistance protein (NB-LRR) which leads to cell death and that C. victoriae exploits this defense response to cause disease. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that victorin sensitivity is conditioned by genes encoding resistance proteins across diverse crop species including barley, rice and bean. We hypothesize that these resistance proteins (NB-LRRs) are functionally, and perhaps structurally, related to the protein encoded by the Vb/Pc2 gene in oats. This proposal will address this hypothesis and in addition investigates the diversity of targets for victorin and the resistance proteins activated.","Our investigations of Arabidopsis, have revealed that an NB-LRR encoding gene called ""LOV"" confers both victorin sensitivity and susceptibility to C. victoriae. Although LOV confers susceptibility, it appears to be a typical resistance (R) gene whose product, shares the same structural and functional requirements as other R proteins and is activated by a mechanism identical to the guard model of R-protein activation. Furthermore, in the absence of LOV, victorin enhances the virulence of biotrophic pathogens. Thus, victorin apparently functions as a biotrophic effector that is recognized as an avirulence determinant by an R gene. In other words, C. victoriae is activating the resistance response (&amp; HR) for disease susceptibility. These results are entirely consistent with Vb and Pc2 in oats occurring as one and the same gene and support that an R gene can confer disease susceptibility. The discovery of victorin sensitivity in Arabidopsis, a species considerably divergent from oats, led us to investigate other plant species with an eye toward further understanding victorin&#39;s mode-of-action and ultimately identifying Vb/Pc2 in oats. We identified sensitivity in common bean, barley, Brachypodium and rice. Mapping data indicted that in all species, sensitivity is conferred by R-like genes (i.e. genes encoding NB-LRRs). Because these genes recognize victorin, they share recognition specificity with Vb in oats. Further, if Vb and Pc2 are identical, then, by definition, Vb/Pc2 confers shared recognition of both victorin and AvrPc2 from P. coronata. Thus, we hypothesize that genes conferring victorin sensitivity from these other species may also confer rust resistance in oats. This hypothesis will be evaluated in Objective 1 entitled: Integrated Anayses of Crown Rust Resistance in Oats. Also, for objective 1, because victorin sensitivity in all species is conferred by genes encoding NB-LRRs, we propose that Vb/Pc2 in oats also encodes an NB-LRR. However, Vb/Pc2 may or may not be orthologous to victorin sensitivity genes identified among the other grasses. Therefore we will take an unbiased, map-based approach informed by bioinformatics and DNA capture technology to identify and clone Vb/Pc2 in oats. Furthermore, evidence generated in Arabidopsis and other species show that victorin is recognized by NB-LRRs that are clearly unrelated to LOV and are activated through a distinct mechanism(s). These findings implicate an intriguing diversity of effector targets for victorin yet also demonstrate consistent activation of resistance-like genes for susceptibility. We will characterize this diversity of genes and victorin target(s) in Objective 2 entitled: Identification of Alternate Virulence Targets of Victorin, In addition to expanding current, growing knowledge of biotrophic effector targets and defense activation, completion of the proposed work promises to clarify the nature of the type of biotrophic effectors that can be exploited by necrotrophs to cause disease, an important, understudied, recently-emerging paradigm for plant-microbe interactions. Further, the proposed efforts will provide insight into the identification and use of nonhost, R-like genes that can be exploited for defense against important pathogens, such as rusts. Additionally, we will finally and unequivocally determine if a true, known R gene can indeed confer plant disease susceptibility, a hypothesis awaiting over 70 years for confirmation. Other expected outputs are training and mentoring particularly of undergraduate students; attendance at conferences and publication of data in peer reviewed manuscripts.","cochliobolus, effectors, puccinia, resistance, rust, susceptibility, Necrotrophs, Victoria Blight"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS,1008605,2016-67012-24834,Role of autophagy in heat stress and feed efficiency in poultry,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,148465.0,"Piekarski, AL, L..",ACTIVE,"This project can be broken down into two main topics: Heat stress and feed efficiency in poultry. Due to animal agriculture facing substantial challenges from a projected increase in demand for high quality animal protein and the need to adapt to higher temperatures due to climate change, increasing production efficiency, especially during periods of heat stress, while reducing the environmental impact and cost of animal protein is essential to achieving a sustainable, affordable, and secure animal protein supply. To see this reduction come to fruition, a better understanding of the mechanistics underlying the causative effects of heat stress must be determined. Autophagy, upregulated during many different types of stress, is a pathway which may contribute greatly to alleviating this issue. Agriculture is an important sector of the U.S. economy, contributing at least $200 billion each year with Americans consuming more than 37 million tons of meat annually.Heat waves, whichare projected to increase under climate change, could directly threaten livestock. In the U.S., a number of states reported losses of more than 5,000 animals due to a single heat wave alone which ends up costing millions of dollars in lost revenue. Therefore, it becomes clear that heat stress is a very real issue and impacts a multi-billion dollar industry that could have significant impacts on global economies in the coming years. Because heat production is a natural occurrence and because these animals have highly metabolically active tissue, poultry suffer from heat stress easily with some succumbing to spiraling hyperthermia due to the inability to regulate body temperature in extreme high temperatures.Therefore, much research has gone into finding a way to alleviate or combat heat stress in these animals. Some groups have used ""thermal conditioning"" which exposes embryos (pre-hatch) or neonates (during the first 4 d post hatch) to high heat conditions, with results showing greater resistance to heat stress and reduced body temperatures.Recently, autophagy, a ""self-eating"" cell survival pathway, has been applied to this condition in plantsin one laboratoryand to chickens in our laboratory. As part of this project, I am planning on continuing my research of heat stress in poultry by observing the autophagy pathway and mapping its mechanistic pathway during heat stress and, in so doing, hope to find a way to alleviate this issue in commerical poultry.In relation to heat stress, feed efficiency (FE) is a very important genetic trait in poultry and livestock that can be negatively impacted by stress of any kind. Autophagic mechanisms were originally discovered in starvation models, linking the importance of this pathway to normal metabolism. An animal that produces either greater body mass with the same feed intake or the same body mass with less feed intake would be considered more efficient than its contemporaries. That having been said, birds that are considered to have better feed efficiency typically have a lower proportion of feed intake to body mass. It has beenstated that generally accepted feed costs represent about 70% of the cost of poultry production making a bird&#39;s ability to use feed efficiently very important. In addition, due to biofuel policies and a growing global demand for animal protein, feed, fuel, and fertilizer costs have been on a steady rise leading to intensified focus on the development of selection strategies for the improvement of FE in poultry and livestock production Changing methods in lighting, temperature, and nutrition with birds have all been ways the industry has tried to manage feed efficiency in meat producing poultry, with genetic selection ultimately having the most impact. It is possible that selection for specific components of energy efficiency, such as utilizing mechanisms of the autophagy pathway, may have a positive effect on the productivity of broilers and broiler breeders. Therefore, one of the goals of this project is to determine the underlying mechanisms behind autophagy and its relation to feed efficiency to observe if this pathway could be another selection startegyfor developing a more efficient animal. This study hopes to answer the question of: ""To what degree does autophagy affect the high and low feed efficiency trait, and could this be a potential aid in helping to solve the feed efficiency problem in the poultry industry and possibly of allproduction animal agriculture?""","Generally, the maingoalof this project are to help understand a little know cell survival pathway, autophagy, in avians. I believe this pathway can have a protective effect in commercial poultry under times of heat stress conditions. Heat stress is responsible for a large amount of morbidity in flocks the world over and is also responsible for farmers and industry losing millions of dollars annually. Autophagy may have a key role in underlying mechanisms in these animals as a cell survival mechanism by clearing out damaged cells and breaking them down into proteins and amino acids that can then be used for energy consuming pathways and in repair mechanisms throughout the animal. I also want to see the effect of autophagy on feed efficiency in these animals. Feed efficiency can generally be described as how well an animal can convert their feed into usable energy. I will be using a quail and chicken line that have been divergently selected over 40 generations for this trait. I want to observe if autophagy is upregulated in the high feed efficient animals over their low feed efficient counterparts, describing a possible mechanism by which these animals are better utilizing their feed. On the other hand, if we see an upregulation in the low feed efficient group, this could mean that autophagy is upregulated in response to a starvation-like prompt in which damaged cells are being degraded and then used in energy consuming pathways so as to provide recycledproteins and amino acids to be utilized.The specific goals to this project are as follows: To determine the effect of heat stress on the gene and protein expression of the autophagy pathway in muscle, liver, adipose, and brain obtained from Japanese Quail selected for; a) susceptibility or resistance to restraint stress, and b) selected for high and low feed efficiency; and to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of heat stress on gene and protein expression of the autophagy pathway in avian muscle and hepatocyte-derived cell lines. I believe these topics will address two problematic issues that are common in live production animal agriculture as well as lead to a possible solution.The last decade has been marked by some of the hottest annual overall temperatures ever recorded and we have experienced, first hand, what that means to live production animal agriculturehere in Arkansas.Thus, it is apparent that we have certainly entered an extended period of hotter than normal climate and we need to study methods that deal in alleviating this issue. It was also stated that the global food demand will double by the year 2050, placing pressure on animal production industries to find a safe, affordable, and humane way of increasing production of a secure animal protein supply.","autophagy, feed efficiency, heat stress, poultry, Quail"
PROJECT,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,1008648,2016-67021-24533,Aromatic Hydrocarbons From Agricultural And Forest Wastes Using Biomass Derived Carbon Catalysts,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,494040.0,"Lei, HA.",ACTIVE,"Aromatics have numerous industrial applications including use in fuels or as chemical precursors for a variety of plastics and resins. Crude oil consists of 33-36% aromatics and gasoline has up to 85% aromatics. However, current aromatics are all from petroleum sources exclusively. As the petroleum industry matured, it faced two problems: increasing the yield of fuels from each barrel of crude oil and decreasing the tendency of fuels to knock when it burned. As an important and the most desired component of gasoline, bunker fuels and aviation fuels, aromatic hydrocarbon has the ability to burn without knocking the engine due to its high octane number. The oil obtained from a biomass pyrolysis process is considered to be a very promising hydrocarbon precursor. Post-pyrolysis upgrading is required to stabilizing the bio-oil to overcome its deleterious properties. However, the current upgrading requires costly hydrogen, the need of expensive precious metal catalysts or sulfide deoxygenation catalysts with challenging issues of catalyst coking. Alternative fuels such as biodiesel are long chain hydrocarbons. Hydrotreating of biomass pyrolysis bio-oils results in ring saturation of aromatics prior to the oxygen removal. Both hydrotreated bio-oil and biodiesel are lack of aromatic hydrocarbons.The project is intended to develop diverse biomass-derived carbon catalysts and aromatic hydrocarbons, a much more sustainable energy source than the fossil oil. The project team is focused directly on integrating the pyrolysis and upgrading technologies employed to convert the agricultural and forestry wastes into aromatic hydrocarbons. The project provides a novel renewable energy conversion system to the industries for sustainably producing biofuels from biomass derived from agricultural and forestry industries, and directly contributes to creating new technology and adding value and profit for those industries. The team will link and engage related industries in our outreach and education efforts and involve them in the development of advanced hydrocarbon fuels.The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of bio-oil upgrading reactions in order to support the development of mathematical models for the design of selective upgrading reactors and understand physical organization and chemical complexity of biomass-derived carbon catalysts. Through this cutting-edge research study we will promote sustainable agriculture and benign environment, and lead to significant benefits to society, specifically: To advance our understanding on how diverse-biomass derived carbon catalysts affect bio-oil upgrading that converts very reactive liquid intermediates from biomass pyrolysis into the aromatic rich fraction; 2) To develop a mathematical model of a packed-bed upgrading reactor to describe the yield of the oxygenated aromatics and their conversions to aromatic hydrocarbons. The project will have a transformational impact on the rural community in the United States by leveraging a feedstock that is currently considered an agricultural/forest waste, creating a ""renewable crude oil alternative"", and producing advance hydrocarbons which have numerous industrial applications with multibillion dollars market.",The long-term goal of this proposed project is to advance our understanding of bio-oil upgrading reactions in order to support the development of mathematical models for the design of selective upgrading reactors and understand physical organization and chemical complexity of biomass-derived carbon catalysts. The supporting objectives include: 1) To advance our understanding on how diverse-biomass derived carbon catalysts affect bio-oil upgrading that converts very reactive liquid intermediates from biomass pyrolysis into the aromatic rich fraction; 2) To develop a mathematical model of a packed-bed upgrading reactor to describe the yield of the oxygenated aromatics and their conversions to aromatic hydrocarbons.,Biomass; carbon catalyst; packed bed reactors; biofuels; aromatic hydrocarbon; scale up

We will pursue these goals by collaborating with business consultants who work with cooperatives (""cooperative developers""), economic developers, and regional cooperative development centers. We will compare the survival rates of rural start-up firms with business transitions (mergers, buyouts, and conversions), and identify a subset of cooperatives and assess their survival rate relative to other firms. We plan to share this information with stakeholders to enhance understanding of the impact of conversions to cooperative ownership.We also propose to identify clusters of cooperative activity by mapping existing cooperatives, recent cooperative start-ups and conversions, and businesses that have high potential for conversion to cooperative ownership, then engage regional cooperative development centers to investigate and write case studies on the institutional environment that supports cooperative development in each cluster. We will use this information to create extension tools that can be used to map cooperative activity and clusters, leading to a better understanding of regional cooperative development opportunities to promote and sustain rural entrepreneurship. We plan to refine these extension tools with project stakeholders and disseminate them widely to policy makers, economic and cooperative developers, and rural entrepreneurs.","Cooperatively owned businesses play an important role in rural economies throughout the United States. Examples include farmer-owned cooperatives and farm credit institutions, rural utility providers, rural credit unions and community banks, service sharing organizations for school districts and health-care providers, and business-to-business purchasing cooperatives that support local retail. Although their presence in rural areas is nearly universal, the extent of cooperative business activity in rural areas varies widely across regions and business sectors.Systemic interventions catalyzed with federal loans and technical assistance spawned nation-wide coverage for utility and farm credit services, but development has been much more uneven in other sectors. There are well-known regional clusters where cooperatives have a relatively strong presence. Unfortunately, we know very little about why cooperatives have been more successful in some areas relative to others, nor about the institutional and business-support infrastructure that they need for on-going success. Business schools and small business assistance programs focus almost exclusively on investor-or privately owned businesses, but cooperatively owned businesses have unique financial, managerial, and governance challenges. This is especially true during start-up when, in addition to all the normal challenges associated with business start-up, cooperative businesses must overcome the organizational difficulties inherent in collective entrepreneurship.Given the important role played by cooperatives in rural areas, we propose to enhance opportunities for rural cooperative entrepreneurship by providing robust decision-making tools and research-based information to cooperative and economic developers, rural entrepreneurs, and policy makers. We will pursue these goals through the following research and extension objectives:Compare the survival rates of rural start-up firms to the survival rates of businesses that have transitioned (mergers, buyouts, or conversions to alternate business structures). Identify a subset of cooperatives and assess their survival rate relative to other firms.Share information with stakeholders to enhance understanding of the impact of conversions to cooperative ownership.Map existing cooperatives and recent cooperative start-ups and conversions in the U.S. and identify regional clusters of cooperative activity.Engage regional cooperative development centers and other stakeholders in a participatory process to better understand clusters of robust cooperative activity and to assess the institutional environment that supports cooperative development and best practices.Develop extension tools including mapping tools to identify regional cooperative clusters and development opportunities, case studies on regional cooperative clusters and best practices in supporting cooperative development, and a comparative analysis of necessary institutional support for cooperative entrepreneurship.Refine extension tools in collaboration with project stakeholders and widely disseminate them to policy makers, cooperative and economic developers, cooperative associations, and rural entrepreneurs.","collective action, cooperatives, economic development, entrepreneurship, rural development"

The assembled group of participants in the RIBT conference will engage in discussions with transportation experts through the conference routes (track sessions) and by hosting a booth at the conference expo. Participants will meet as a group during the conference to develop a white paper on the needs for economic research related to rural transportation, especially among the elderly and disadvantaged populations. The participants will continue to collaborate on the white paper, outreach materials, presentations at academic conferences, and a journal article via email and web meetings after the conference.As with all important social issues, many disciplines are involved in research concerning mobility for the rural elderly and other disadvantaged populations. However, research on the economics of public transportation targeting these groups is scant. Interactions between economists, transportation researchers, and service providers, while currently limited, are crucial to improving the efficiency of rural transportation services. The need for improved rural transit for the targeted populations is significant because many rural communities have aging populations and widely varying transportation services and opportunities. The aging baby boomer generation will only intensify the situation as they age in place and move to rural communities (Rosenbloom 2004; U.S. Department of Agriculture 2007).We focus on the rural elderly but realize that similar issues are faced in providing transportation to other rural disadvantaged populations, including handicapped, minority and poor individuals. Although the remainder of this document primarily references rural elderly, issues affecting other disadvantaged populations will be considered throughout the project. Furthermore, many of the same populations who rely on public transportation are clients of other regionally provided services (e.g., health and mental health services for rural populations), and economic research within those fields is relevant. Goals and ObjectivesThe long-term goal of the proposed conference is to enhance the provision of rural transportation options that strengthen regional economies and improve quality of life for the rural elderly and other disadvantaged rural populations. Effective improvements in rural transportation for the elderly will lead to rural community development and overall general improvements in transportation in rural settings. Research-based improvements in the transportation sector are also expected to inform research and policy in other aspects of regional rural service provision. The project aims to catalyze research on the economics of rural transportation by convening established and early career professionals with an interest in rural transportation topics to identify priorities, establish a network of collaborators, and publish pieces that can be used to help obtain research funding. Further, the white paper will provide guidance to the USDA on transportation needs of rural, agriculture-dominated communities.Goal 1 (Research): Establish a network of economic scholars who engage with rural transportation providers and researchers to identify research priorities.Objective 1.1: Develop a comprehensive literature review focused on studies addressing rural transportation and the elderly, as well as the economics of other regionally provided services.Objective 1.2: Identify opportunities for early career professionals, including graduate students, who are interested in pursuing rural issues including transportation as an integral component of their current and future research portfolios.Objective 1.3: Gain insight into the economic research needs of rural transportation providers, policy makers, and researchers and explore how economic tools can meet these needs through participation in the Rural Public and Intercity Bus Transportation (RIBT) Conference.Objective 1.4: Through participation in the RIBT Conference and white paper development, promote collaboration and networks to enhance future cooperation.Goal 2 (Research and Extension): Create and publicize a white paper and materials describing opportunities for research on rural transportation that can be used to help obtain research funding and establish the topic as a relevant area of applied economics, along with providing the USDA with guidance on rural issues.Objective 2.1: Develop a white paper describing research priorities based interactions at and after the conference.Objective 2.2: Summarize the white paper into a journal review article describing the state of research and needs for future research based on the white paper.Objective 2.3: Create fact sheets educating county and district Extension faculty in related fields (e.g., community development, gerontology, and financial management) and rural community leaders about important economic concerns in rural transportation.Objective 2.4: Communicate findings at relevant meetings and conferences regularly attended by collaborators and our economics colleagues.Rationale and SignificanceRural transit is the lifeblood for millions of elderly Americans (Lynott 2013). Transit will become even more important in these rural areas based on demographic trends including a growth in persons age 65 and over, an expected increase in the rural elderly population, and an expected decrease in overall population density in many rural areas. Cromartie and Nelson (2009) note the rural and small-town population aged age 55-75 is expected to increase from 8.6 million to 14 million people between 2000 and 2020. Murdoch et al. (2014) specifically note the need for public transportation given growing populations of elderly, minority, and low-income populations.Besides demographic changes, for many rural areas the trend is away from town centers to regionalized shopping and medical services that adds to the challenges faced by transit providers. These trends and changes, along with insufficient budgets, suggest rural transit providers will face increasing challenges to maintain service effectiveness. Research is necessary to better assess how public transit services in rural areas can maintain and enhance services through coordination and innovative programs to better serve the aging population.However, research on the economics of public transportation for rural elderly is scant. Rural transportation for the elderly tends to be treated as a component of aging in place within the fields of rural sociology and gerontology (Keith, 2012; Dobbs and Strain, 2008). The economics of meeting the elderly&#39;s transportation needs are rarely addressed, although the costs may be acknowledged. Interestingly, work that has been published by economists tends to be in non-economic journals (Stern 1993; Fitzgerald, Shaunesey, and Stern 2000; Shields, Stallman, and Deller, 2003; Bearse et al. 2004; Israel-Schwarzlose et al. 2014).While economists and other academics often wish to publish in other disciplines to get their work into the hands of practitioners in those fields, failing to publish in economics and applied economics journals limits interest among young faculty who are expected to publish in journals prestigious within their field. At the same time, there appears to be limited interaction between economists, transportation researchers, and service providers. Fostering collaboration of young scholars and economists with a track record of working in the field of rural transportation can speed the transfer of knowledge and establish the legitimacy of this field.","Efficient transportation is important to the regional economy and residents&#39; quality of life.

Recently, a number of outbreaks of foodborne illness have been attributed to Salmonella on low-moisture foods. These foods were previously thought to be relatively low-risk for transmitting foodborne illness, as they do not support growth of microbes. Effective preventative controls are needed to reduce the risk of human illness associated with these foods. The use of vacuum steam pasteurization is expected to have greater efficacy against pathogens, as moist heat is more effective at inactivating microbes compared to dry heat. Characterizing the biological factors that impact thermal resistance of Salmonella on low-moisture foods will aid in development of effective strategies to inactivate this pathogen using vacuum steam pasteurization. This information should increase the options for food processors to effectively control Salmonella in low-moisture foods.","The goal of this project is to quantify the influence of biological variables on Salmonella thermal inactivation on low-moisture foods during vacuum steam pasteurization. This will be accomplished with the following objectives:1. quantify the effect of inoculum level on Salmonella inactivation by vacuum steam pasteurization on three different low-moisture foods2. quantify the amount of variation in inactivation parameters that are due to biological effects including strains, food matrix, and length of incubation time before processing",Salmonella; low-moisture foods; pasteurization
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN,1008369,2016-67013-24419,Understanding The Effect Of Long-Term Selection On The Genetic Control And Modulation Of Genotype-By-Environment Interaction,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,495000.0,"DE LEON GATTI, NA.",ACTIVE,"High productivity in crops has been achieved through decades of rigorous selection and breeding. Through this process, genetic variability present in these superior varieties is expected to have diminished compared to their less improved counterparts. The ability of plants to thrive under diverse environmental conditions is largely determined by the extent of the genetic variability present in those individuals. The hypothesis here is that selection for superior performance in crop species has therefore reduced the plasticity that allows plants to change their phenotypic expression depending on the effect of environmental influences. To test this hypothesis, this project will first aim to dissect the genetic architecture of this phenotypic plasticity capacity, also known as genotype by environment (G X E), by evaluating the phenotypic and genotypic variability of a diverse collection of maize hybrids grown as part of the nation-wide collaborative Maize G X E project that is part of the Genomes to Fields initiative. As part of this project, we also plan to exploit the genotypic and phenotypic variability present in a collection of maize inbred lines derived from the Iowa Stiff Stalk (BSSS) maize population. This set of diverse materials include lines derived from the BSSS population before any selection was ever applied on it, also inbreds derived from earlier cycles of selection and then finally elite lines recently derived from materials originated from this population that have undergone intense selection. Comparisons of genotypic and phenotypic variation observed in this collection of materials will provide an initial answer to our primary research questions. In addition to that, increased planting density has been identified as one of the most important agronomic factors enhancing productivity in modern maize. Another objective of this project is to determine if insensitivity to planting density is a major contributor to the ability of plants to tolerate environmental influences. For that, a subset of the BSSS derived lines will be evaluated at different planting densities. Results generated by the overall project are expected to enhance our understanding of how rigorous selection and breeding could affect the ability of plants to interact with their surroundings. Deepening our understanding of how the interaction between plants and environments is modulated will directly impact the decision making process of practical plant breeding programs.","Rigorous breeding processes and the deployment of modern agronomic practices have rendered modern crop varieties remarkable levels of productivity. However, the question remains if this process of selecting for superior productivity has affected the ability of these improved cultivars to consistently adapt to variable environments. The capacity of plants to acclimate to their surrounding depends mostly on the extent and nature of standing genetic variation. If selection has narrowed down the available genetic variability present in improved genotypes, it can be hypothesized that the ability of plants to withstand changing environmental conditions has been proportionally reduced in that process. A more in-depth understanding of the genetic architecture and modulation of the mechanisms controlling phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of individuals to express different phenotypes in response to the environment, also known as genotype-by-environment (GXE), is expected to provide an opportunity to better assess the effect of selection for high-productivity on the ability of specific genotypes to respond to ever-changing environmental influences.This project presented here seeks to utilize the Iowa Stiff Stalk (BSSS) maize population, one of the most influential sources of maize germplasm in North America, and derivative inbred lines to answer fundamental questions about the control and modulation of G X E in the context of a highly selected maize population. The specific hypotheses to be addressed in this project are:1. What types of genetic modulation controls G X E in a collection of diverse genotypes? What types of variants explain most of the G X E across different economical and agronomic important traits?2. Has directed artificial selection for high productivity reduced the proportion of the variation that can be explained by G X E across different traits?3. Planting density is one of the most important agronomic factors enhancing productivity in modern maize; is insensitivity to planting density a major contributor to G X E?","genetic architecture, maize, selection, Genotype-by-environment, genetic modulation"
PROJECT,SAES - NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008376,2016-67012-24696,The effect of benign volatile plant compounds on soybean yield,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,149997.0,"Heath, JE, JA.",ACTIVE,"This project aims to test the effect of two volatile plant compounds (methyl salicylate and 2-phenylethanol) on soybean yield. Work with volatile plant compounds has suggested that they can increase the local density of herbivore enemies, but few of these studies have measured effects on fitness endpoints such as yield. My colleagues and I have shown in preliminary studies that these two compounds can increase soybean yield by as much as 25%, but the mechanism of this increase is not understood. Using field experiments, phytohormone analysis, and structural equation modelling, I plan to test four mechanistic hypotheses for this yield increase. The hypotheses include (1) the attraction of natural enemies, (2) the attraction of pollinators, (3) hormonal changes in resource allocation away from defense and toward seeds, and (4) negative effects on pathogenic nematodes caused by (a) the induction of defense pathways or (b) the direct effect of these compounds. I expect to find a hormonally induced redistribution of resources in the plant governed by cross-talk between defense pathways. This would allow plants to cope with a changing environment and may be one of the major mechanisms of plant tolerance to herbivory and a potential entry point to increase agricultural efficiency, adjust to climate change, and increase food security and safety. The plant compounds I propose to study are environmentally benign and one is currently used in high levels as a food flavor additive. Therefore, they represent practical, competitively priced, safe alternatives or additional strategies to increase crop yields. In addition to furthering the research goals of the AFRI ELI program, this project will also train at least three undergraduate students in experimental design, data management, data collection, data analysis, and various field and laboratory techniques.","The overall goal of the project is to manipulate plant defense and resource allocation pathways in soybean to arrive at higher yields through the application of benign volatile precursors to two main plant hormones. To achieve this goal, we plan to fullfill the following specific objectives.(1) Field test the effects of methyl salicylate and 2-phenylenthanol on, soybean resistance, chemical defense indices, pollinators and natural enemies, and plant resource allocation.(2) Construct a structural equation model (SEM) to reveal the major factors affecting yield and enemy pressure.(3) Use field experiments to test the generality of the major predictions of the SEM on several soybean lines.","glycine max, herbivores, natural enemies, phytohormones, pollinators, soybean cyst nematodes, soybeans"

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND,1009305,2016-68008-25074,Implementing disease forecasting in Mid-Atlantic strawberry production to promote industry sustainability,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,200000.0,"Swett, CA.",ACTIVE,"Strawberries are the top grossing fruit crop in the mid-Atlantic, valued at $250 to $500/hundredweight in 2015. Over 1600 farmers in the region depend on this crop as their only source of spring income, and a way to kick off the agrotourism season.Fruit rot diseases are one of the major stakeholder-identified factors limiting strawberry production in the Mid-Atlantic and the single most significant obstacle to profitable production. The Critical Needs and Priorities for the Southeast Strawberry Industry assessment placed studies of fruit rot epidemiology as a top research priority in the region (Anonymous 2000). Fruit rots must be controlled preventatively, and with climate changes hindering disease prediction abilities based on past records, growers must apply protective fungicides every week. Much like over use of antibiotics results in resistance in humans, overuse of fungicides results in resistance in fungi. In the last ten years, fruit rot pathogens become resistant a majority of available reduced-risk fungicides, and every year, farms experience losses from fruit rot due to product failures.Growers prefer to use reduced-risk compounds due to minimized health and environmental impacts, and it is an EPA priority to minimize the use of broad spectrum compounds. However, with the widespread development of resistance, growers are relying more heavily on broad spectrum products, including Captan and Thiram, which are much more harmful to human and environmental health. Downstream environmental impacts of intensive fungicide use, include the recently identified connection between bloom-time applications of Captan and chlorothalonil with colony collapse of honey bees and negative effects of agronomic chemical accumulation in watersheds on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay. Risk-based fungicide use has been identified as an essential component to the solution.Due to both environmental and human health concerns, the region has seen a dramatic increase in consumer preference for reduced spray, ""sustainably"" produced fruits. In result, conventional growers are seeing declines in their customer base. It is anticipated that in the next ten years, minimal fungicide programs will be necessary to maintain a consumer base. Thus, growers are under dividing pressures to successfully produce a profitable crop and to produce a crop which was grown with minimal chemical use.This project was developed in response to grower requests for a reliable, environmentally friendly, economically sound method of reducing fungicide use, to lower the chances of on-site fungicide failures and maintain efficacy of reduced-risk compounds. The southern states (Florida and South Carolina) have established a disease forecasting system, referred to as the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS), which has been highly effective in reducing fungicide use and preserving effective chemistries. Based on preliminary evaluations in 2015 in Maryland and Pennsylvania, this system has potential to reduce fungicide applications in the mid-Atlantic region by 35-80%. Many growers already use risk-based strategies to control fire blight on apples in the region and 2015 surveys indicate that at least 60% of mid-Atlantic strawberry growers have immediate interest in using a forecasting system for strawberry fruit rot.Adoption of SAS in the mid-Atlantic is limited by several critical barriers. First, although most of the larger growers report that they would be willing to reduce fungicide applications based on estimates of risk, they require regional evidence that this method will not increase their disease losses. Approximately 85% of all farms grow less than one acre of strawberries, making it too high risk to independently test out this new system on even a small area. It is possible that the system may prove less effective in these states, due to higher inoculum loads or differences in the susceptibility of varieties grown in this area. To facilitate adoption by producers, regional efficacy trials are needed to validate efficacy.In addition, although most of the large, well-established growers understand the concept of risk-based management, less than 10% of the smaller growers (&lt; 1 acre) and newer growers (active &lt; 10 years) have an understanding of how these tools can function. This is attributed largely to a lack of outreach efforts aimed at educating strawberry growers about fungicide resistance and risk-based management options in this region in the last decade. Any research efforts therefore require complimentary education efforts in concert, to promote an understanding of how disease forecasting works.Adoption of a risk-based fungicide program is also critically constrained by the absence of a regional weather station network in AgroClimate (http://agroclimate.org/) which is needed to extend the Strawberry Advisory System risk assessment tool (http://agroclimate.org/tools/strawberry/) to the mid-Atlantic region. Establishment of station networks is challenged by the diversity of microclimates represented by the major production areas. It is estimated that approximately 50 to 70% of all producers are located in five climactically distinct regions: Virginia Beach (VA), Central / Western MD, eastern shore (VA, MD and DE), and Lancaster county (PA). Two weather stations have been established by the lead PI (Swett) on the eastern shore and in western MD. In order to minimally reach 50% of growers in the mid-Atlantic, stations are needed in all other major production regions.The specific objectives of this study are to:Validate a disease forecasting system for timing fungicide applications to control strawberry fruit rots in the mid-Atlantic;Extend the SAS tool to mid-Atlantic growers: Establish a mid-Atlantic weather station network in AgroClimate and integrate into the SAS disease forecasting website, App, and SMS alert system;Facilitate adoption by educating growers on efficacy and use of the disease forecasting system through grower and extension led outreach efforts.To improve system sustainability our short-term goals are to validate efficacy of risk-based spray programs in controlling fruit rot pathogens in the mid-Atlantic region and facilitate implementation in grower fields by establishing a mid-Atlantic weather station network to develop a disease forecasting website, App, and SMS alert system. By the end of the project period, we aim to have a sensor network in place that reliably predicts risk for 50-70% of all strawberry growers in MD, PA and VA. We aim to inform 50-75% of MD, PA and VA strawberry growers on the efficacy and approach to using SAS, primarily through grower-led field days at on-farm trial sites and to see 30-50% growers referring to SAS to inform sprays, with at least 10% of growers using SAS instead of calendar sprays by the end of the project period. Our medium-term goals in the years following the study are to see SAS adoption by 50% of growers in the region, with a 20-50% reduction in fungicide application frequency, resulting in grower savings associated with spray reductions.The long-term goals are to preserve the efficacy of existing compounds currently at risk of resistance development for both pathogens. We aim to increase customer desirability for locally produced strawberries, measured as the customer numbers and increased market value, which, in line with NIFA purpose and priority goals, will sustain the economic viability of farm operations. Health benefits associated with reductions in use of broad spectrum compounds can enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. Also in alignment with NIFA purposes and priorities, we aim to enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base on which the agricultural economy depends by reducing use of broad spectrum pesticides at bloom, mitigating indirect effects on honey bee health.","Strawberries are a staple crop in diversified agricultural production, and one of the top grossing fruit crops in the mid-Atlantic. Fruit rot disease management is essential for profitable production and currently relies on calendar-based fungicide applications. Facing critical losses associated with fungicide failures, growers have requested solutions that preserve effective chemistries. The southeast has developed the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS), a risk-based disease forecasting tool which has reduced fungicide applications by up to 50%. Growers in the mid-Atlantic are interested in using risk-based management; however, the southeast system does not presently include the mid-Atlantic and regional validation trials are requisite to grower adoption.To address these barriers, we integrate one research and two extension objectives in this multi-state study:1. Validate a disease forecasting system for timing fungicide applications to control strawberry fruit rots in the mid-Atlantic;2. Extend the SAS tool to mid-Atlantic growers: Establish a mid-Atlantic weather station network in AgroClimate and integrate into the SAS disease forecasting website, App, and SMS alert system;3. Facilitate adoption by educating growers on efficacy and use of the disease forecasting system through grower and extension led outreach efforts.In line with CARE priorities, our goal is ""to develop and implement solutions to critical producer problems associated with crop production, protection, and product quality."" Stakeholders are participants in validation and outreach efforts, and project advisors.Outcome: provide a new tool for mid-Atlantic growers to minimize losses from fungicide failures, preserve effective chemistries, and improve economic viability through consumer market expansion and direct cost savings.","disease forecasting, fruit rot, fungicide resistance, strawberry"

Because of the potential for antibiotic resistance and the transfer of resistant genes in humans, it is desirable to find an alternative treatment, one that relies upon the natural honey bee immune system.

PROJECT,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,1008858,2016-67015-24968,A Pioneering Approach to Tick Control: Anti-tick Toxins Delivered via a Tick Transmissible Pathogen,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,500000.0,"Ueti, MA, W..",ACTIVE,"Ticks are bloodsucking arthropods that cause substantial economic loss to the cattle industry directly and through the transmission of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and parasites. It is estimated that ticks and tick-borne pathogens cause annual losses of &gt; $20 billion US dollars worldwide. Currently, the most effective and widely used method to minimize tick feeding and control transmission of pathogens is the use of chemical acaricides. However, long-term use has led to acaricide-resistant tick populations and created environmental concerns. The recent discovery of ticks in Mexico with resistance to multiple acaricides raises concerns regarding the spread of ticks that transmit parasites lethal to cattle resulting in economic losses to the US cattle industry. Although anti-tick vaccines have been developed, their efficacy is less than ideal. By far, the most effective and commonly used vaccines against tick transmitted parasites are based on live parasites. However, due to safety concerns these vaccines are not licensed in the US. Therefore, safer, more effective and environmentally friendly approaches to controlling ticks and the parasites they transmit, are desirable. Bio-insecticides such as toxins derived from spider venom offer a potential strategy to control ticks if necessary dosages could be efficiently delivered. This project investigates the novel approach of using genetically modified, tick-transmissible parasites as a delivery platform for an anti-tick toxin to target and kill ticks. By specifically targeting transmitting ticks, this strategy has the potential dual benefit of acting as an anti-disease vaccine while also reducing tick populations. We will test the hypothesis that a genetically modified Babesia parasite can be engineered to express a spider toxin within the tick thus targeting and killing pathogen transmitting ticks. This requires demonstrating that spider toxins delivered via an attenuated parasite kills ticks. Vaccination of cattle with this modified B. bovis strain is hypothesized to protect cattle against disease and interrupt transmission by killing ticks.","Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasitic arthropods that cause significant economic loss to the livestock industry directly and through the pathogens they transmit. Currently, acaricides are widely used to minimize tick infestation and thereby control transmission of pathogens. Long-term acaricide use has led to acaricide-resistant tick populations and created environmental concerns. The discovery of Rhipicephalus tick populations with multiple acaricide-resistances in Mexico raises concerns regarding geographic and numerical tick expansion into Rhipicephalus-free areas of the United States and a corresponding increase in the risk of transmission of Babesia parasites. The goal of this proposal is to develop safe, effective and environmentally friendly approaches to control ticks and tick-borne pathogens. To accomplish this goal, we will generate a genetically modified B. bovis parasite expressing a spider toxin under the control of a tick stage specific promoter and test the genetically modified parasite as an anti-tick toxin delivery platform during cattle infestation with R. microplus. The novelty of this proposal is the use of genetically modified live-attenuated tick transmissible parasites to express an anti-tick protein toxin during a B. bovis life stage that occurs exclusively within the tick vector, thus specifically targeting and killing the tick. This strategy has the dual benefit of providing a vaccine against bovine babesiosis while simultaneously working to reduce tick burden and pathogen transmission.","transfection, Babesia bovis, Rhipicephalus microplus, tick transmission"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,1008896,2016-67023-24902,Assessing Effects of Federal Corp Insurance on Supply of Specialty Crops,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,474132.0,"Sumner, DA.",ACTIVE,"Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of the pattern of production of specialty crops, and in particular, the role of crop insurance in this pattern across crops and locations. The long-term research goal may also be stated as the question: as the availability and specific features of crop insurance for specialty crops has changed and continues to change, how will the changes in relative incentives affect the production of individual crops across the United States?First, we will construct a detailed, crop- and region-specific data base of crop production and insurance for specialty crops at the national level. As discussed in the data section, data on specialty crops area available from a number of sources. We will collect those data and put them in a single place so that they are easily available to governmental agencies and specialty crop researchers.Second, we will quantitatively evaluate, using a variety of statistical and econometric tools, how the spread of crop insurance is affecting specialty crop production and cropping patterns across states and counties. We test whether crop insurance induces additional acreage of specialty crops, and whether the effect on acreage occurring in regions that previously had fewer acres and may be less suitable for the crops. We will use the best and most disaggregated information available on acreage and yields in well specified causal models. In order to identify causal impacts, we take careful account of what drives the availability of crop insurance. Crop insurance availability for a specific crop in a particular region depends on local production conditions of that specific crop. This heterogeneity is a major feature of modeling specialty crop supply response. Our approach incorporates endogenous availability of crop insurance into models of specialty crop supply. The incorporation of availability of crop insurance in our model is a significant contribution.  Third, based on the estimation results obtained in the second objective, we will project the likely expansion of crop insurance for specialty crops and resulting supply responses at the regional and national levels. Better projections of crop production patterns have implications for projections of variables such as market prices or exports. Estimation results will guide answers to questions such as: if crop insurance were to become available for additional crops, what would be the effect on acreage of those crops, where would that acreage be located and what would be the government cost implications?Fourth, we will analyze market and environmental implications based on our model estimation results. Many specialty crops are perishable and have relatively high seasonal shares of domestic production in domestic consumption, which contributes to potentially high correlation between quantity supplied and market price. By aggregating the supply response at the national level, our estimation of specialty crop supply response will measure the extent to which crop insurance has affected the specialty crop market. Furthermore, we will draw environmental implications from the patterns of input use and land use.Finally, we will develop a research-to-policy-to-action network to ensure that data tools and research findings are promptly shared with public agencies, farm- and commodity-organizations, policy makers, journalists, academic audiences, and the general public. We will use multiple communication vehicles to reach these audiences, including traditional communication channels for research findings (personal communication, workshops, forums, and peer-reviewed publications) and electronic delivery modes (easy-to-use web portals, including data query and mapping tools). Additionally, we will produce issues briefs as a means to inform our audiences about important challenges, opportunities, policy topics, and research findings.","The rationale for the proposed research on the effects of crop insurance on specialty crop production patterns is based on the following key facts:a. Specialty crops are a large and growing part of U.S. agriculture with an important national scope. The commodities included in the proposed research represent a wide range of crops including perennial tree and vine crops as well as annual vegetable, berry and melon crops and other horticultural crops.b. The Agricultural Act of 2014 is the latest in a series of legislation over the past two decades that have expanded the important role of crop insurance for specialty crops. The Act once again mandated the RMA to improve and expand crop insurance for specialty crops. Consequently we expect availability and use of crop insurance for specialty crops to continue increasing over the five year term of the new farm bill.c. Given the diversity of specialty crops across products and space, the expansion of crop insurance availability and significance for specialty crops demands far more attention by economic and econometric models. Such modeling of the effects of the expansion of crop insurance is required for effective policy evaluation and market analysis.d. To date, there has been relatively little research on crop insurance, or other risk management tools for specialty crops. Most studies on crop insurance focus on field crops. While we can draw insights from this prior research, the anticipated models and outcomes are likely to differ significantly due to distinct product characteristics, markets and production practices.","availability, crop insurance, insurance, response, specialty crops, supply, yield, acreage, supply insurance"
PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI,1008909,2016-68004-24827,Identifying local adaptation and creating region-specific genomic predictions in beef cattle,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,2000000.0,"Decker, JA, EG.",ACTIVE,"Cattle poorly adapted to their environment result in lost revenue and jeopardize the stability of the food supply. Large scale genetic data (i.e. genomic data) now allows us to rigorously analyze genetic adaptations and avoid the breeding of animals that will not thrive.We will use genomic methods to precisely identify DNA variants responsible for local adaption to tolerate biotic and abiotic threats to production, enhance resilience of beef production, and enhance beef quality and quantity. The project will achieve three objectives:Identify DNA variants responsible for regional genetic adaptationCreate geographic region-specific genomic predictions, focusing on adaptation variants from Objective 1.Educate the next generation of beef producers to fully embrace and properly use animal breeding tools.Analyzing more than 170,000 cattle with ~15 million high-accuracy DNA variants, we will use selection mapping to identify detailed chromosome regions (e.g. genes) responsible for local adaptation. We will also identify gene-by-environment interactions using multiple statistical methods. When local genetic adaptations exist, ranking animals using a regional genetic evaluation will be different from national cattle evaluations. Focusing on loci under regional genetic adaptation selection or with gene-by-environment interactions, we will develop region-specific genomic predictions. These genomic predictions will allow rapid identification of cattle best suited to an environment. Beef producers have not embraced appropriate animal breeding practices and new technologies, limiting genetic improvement of efficient, high quality beef cattle. We will create engaging curriculum for youth and undergraduate education, including internships, to train the next generation of beef producers.","Of the major livestock sectors, beef cattle are the most exposed to abiotic and biotic stressors. While poultry, swine, and dairy operations typically keep the animals in consistent and protected confinement, provided necessary medical care, and provide a balanced total mixed ration diet allowing the environment of the animals to be maximally controlled, beef cows are grazed on range or pastures where they are exposed to a myriad of environmental stressors (National Research Council. Committees On Animal Nutrition, 1981).Beef cattle that are poorly adapted to the environment in which they live result in lost revenues and jeopardize the stability of the United States food supply. One prominent example in the U.S. beef industry is susceptibility to fescue toxicosis. Fescue has an endophyte fungus which produces ergot-like alkaloids which are toxic to animals. These toxins cause vasoconstriction, reduced appetite, poor reproduction, slowed growth, and exacerbate heat stress. In 1993, it was estimated that fescue toxicosis cost the U.S. beef industry $609 million annually (Hoveland, 1993). After adjusting for inflation, this translates to $998 million in 2014 dollars, but this adjustment ignores increased feeder calf and crop prices, so the true current cost is even greater. Losses also occur due to poor adaptation to high altitude, humid, arid, hot, and cold environments (Hohenboken et al., 2005). However, these issues can be alleviated, because there is ample variation in taurine cattle populations to make improvement. One of the ways for animals to cope with fescue and heat stress is to shed their winter hair coat in the spring, and hair shedding is a heritable trait (Gray et al., 2011). Genetic variance is appreciable for other adaptive traits, such as pulmonary arterial pressure with a heritability of 0.34 (Shirley et al., 2008). While indicine cattle have been used to breed cattle adapted to hot climates, this is not optimal and does not address when the stressors are not heat. Further, beef from indicine cattle has reduced palatability (O&#39;Connor et al., 1997), thus decreasing demand and limiting the profits and sustainability of producers who use indicine genetics. As genetic variation is present within taurine cattle for adaptation to the various U.S. environments, the sustainable strategy is to utilize existing variation through artificial selection. What is needed are breeding decision tools to identify taurine animals adapted to regional environments, even when we do not necessarily know the traits leading to that adaptation.The beef industry has the most distributed breeding decision structure compared to all other major agricultural species, plants and animals included. Rather than germplasm and breeding populations controlled by large companies with highly trained breeders making the selection decisions, in the beef industry there are approximately 742,500 cow-calf operations and every operation makes their own breeding decisions. (In the United States there are 29.7 million beef cows divided by 40 head per operation into 742,500 operations. See http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/background.aspx and http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx.) Furthermore, these beef producers do not typically use optimal breeding practices. For example, a BEEF magazine article from January 29, 2014 reported a survey that found beef producers are more likely to select animals using actual trait records than use the more accurate genetic predictions (expected progeny differences, EPDs), and they are also more likely to select on individual traits and EPDs than use optimal economic selection indexes. The accuracy of selection decisions is higher when genetic predictions are used, thus response to selection will be more rapid. Vice versa, the accuracy of selection on actual trait measurements is limited by the heritability of the trait and is further reduced by the failure to correct for confounding environmental effects and is therefore far less accurate. Use of these faulty practices would likely lead to the dismissal of a plant or animal breeder in other agricultural sectors. A major educational effort is needed to enable and persuade the next generation of beef producers to understand and adopt these optimal breeding practices to ensure that beef production in the United States increases economic prosperity, national resilience and food security.Overview of ObjectivesThe overall goal of this project is to create tools, genomic predictions, which will allow beef producers to identify and breed cattle which are adapted to their production environment. Briefly summarized, our objectives are to:1. Identify genomic variants or loci responsible for regional adaptation.2. Create geographic region-specific genomic predictions, focusing on regional adaptation variants from Objective 1.3. Educate the next generation of beef producers to fully embrace and properly use animal breeding tools.","adaptation, education, qtl, selection, technology adoption, Gene-by-Environment, Genomic Prediction"

World-wide, forests are affected by non-native organisms in a variety of taxa, including woody and herbaceous plants, arthropods, pathogens, birds, mammals and fish. While consderable progress has been made in understanding the causes and consequences of invasions as well as strategies for their management, there remain mainy usolved problems. The proposed conference would bring scientists together from several different countries to present state-of-knowledge summaries of various aspects of the problem of biological invasions in forests. These topics include both biological aspects of invasions, but also social aspects, which are increasingly recognized to be crucial topics in both understanding and solving these problems. The intent in organizing this conference is to spark communication among different scientific disciplines and world regions with the expectation that this will result in new insight into the invasive species problem in forests. We plan for the conference to also be attended by other scientists and by forest managers, quarantine specialists, research managers and pest mangers with the intention that they will gain knowledge. The material presented at the conference will also be summarized in a special journal issue and synthesis manuscript that will provide an additional instruments for communicating this information to stakeholders and policymakers.","The purpose of this project is to hold an international conference that focuses on all aspects ofbiological invasions in forests. Funds will be used entirely to cover costs of invited participants. The conference will include presentations by invited speakers plus a limitted number of contributed presentations.The conference will be held from July 19-22 in Shepherdstown, WV at the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service National Conservation Training Center.","alien species, forestry, invasive species, non-native, non-indigenous"

The U.S.A swine industry is the leading pork exporter, accounting for &gt;28% of global exports, and is thus a major source of food, revenue, and employment. The pathogen poses a high risk to the U.S.A swine industry as it continues to spread globally and therefore, it is important that innovative products are developed to safeguard the industry. There is no vaccine or treatment available for controlling this disease and therefore, development of an effective and safe vaccine is necessary for use in case there is an outbreak in North America. We have developed two rationally designed vaccine candidates and tested their ability to safely induce immune responses in commercial pigs. The goal of the current project is to determine whether the vaccine candidates can confer protection of pigs against the virus.There is scientific evidence to show that protection against the African swine fever virus can be stimulated with a vaccine since pigs that recover from infection with isolates that do not cause disease are protected against isolates that cause disease. Due to safety concerns, development of a vaccine based on carefully selected virus proteins, as opposed to an attenuated live virus vaccine, is more attractive for use in U.S.A since the virus is not present in North America. However, the current challenges are identification of suitable virus vaccine candidate proteins and an effective way for immunizing pigs. Candidate vaccines formulated using one or two African swine fever virus proteins have so far failed to induce acceptable protection. It is envisaged that development of an effective vaccine will require identification and validation of multiple suitable candidate proteins that will induce significant protection in majority of the vaccinated pigs.The vaccine candidates that we have developed contain multiple promising African swine fever virus proteins and immunization of commercial pigs with the vaccines induced promising immune responses that increased over a ten week period after inoculation of a single dose. Overall, the vaccines were well tolerated and no serious negative effects were observed. Notably, all the pigs responded well to each virus component included in the vaccine. In addition, the induced responses increased dramatically after inoculation of a booster dose. More importantly, the induced immune responses strongly recognized the actual African swine fever virus. Taken together, the outcomes from this study showed that the vaccine is capable of safely inducing strong immune responses in commercial pigs. The next logical step is to test whether the vaccines can confer protection to pigs against the virus. The study will be conducted by immunizing pigs with the candidate vaccines. Na&iuml;ve pigs will serve as negative controls. The pigs will be challenged with a lethal dose of the virus to evaluate protection. Successful development of an effective vaccine is critical for the containment of an African swine virus outbreak and safeguarding of the U.S.A pig industry. In addition, such a vaccine will play a critical role in controlling global spread of the virus and reduce outbreaks in endemic regions.",1) Evaluate protective efficacy of adenovirus-vectored ASFV multivalent cocktail2) Evaluate protective efficacy of adenovirus-vectored chaperoned ASFV multivalent cocktail,"African swine fever virus, swine, Transboundry animal disease Proto-type vaccine, live vector"

In this proposal we will examine the functions of interferon gamma and interferon delta. Specific objectives are to: (1) inhibit synthesis of interferon gamma and interferon delta IFNG and IFND by porcine placentae; (2) infuse interferon gamma and interferon delta into nonpregnant pigs; and (3) inhibit synthesis of interferon gamma and interferon delta, then infuse interferon gamma and interferon delta to rescue embryonic development.

Effective strategies to combat the heat stress-induced reduction in fertility have been slow to develop because of the unique physiology of heat stressed dairy cattle. Indeed, the endocrinology and metabolism of a heat stressed dairy cow is unlike any other physiological state. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the altered endocrinology and metabolism of the heat stressed dairy cow is a significant contributor to the observed reduction in fertility, and is additive or maybe even synergistic with the direct effects of heat stress on reproductive components. If this is indeed the case, management strategies that address the altered endocrinology/metabolism can be added to current heat mitigation protocols to significantly improve the reproductive performance of heat stressed dairy cattle. In order to determine the relative contribution of altered endocrinology/metabolism, sequential treatments and analyses will be conducted during this project and detrimental effects on individual components of the ovary will be examined. The results of the planned experiments will broaden the current understanding of heat stress physiology, specifically as it pertains to the lactating dairy cow and her reproductive competency. The anticipated impact of this project, and the resulting knowledge is that heat mitigation strategies will be expanded to address the unique physiology of the lactating dairy cow, thereby improving productivity and reducing the cost of production during periods of heat stress.","The major, over-archinggoalof this project isto improve the reproductive performance of dairy cattle by investigatingthe reproductive consequencesof altered physiology/endocrinology observedduring periods of heat stress.

Resource depletion is undoubtedly a major contributor to crop yield loss; as weeds use water, nutrients, and light, there is less available for the crop. But other mechanisms also contribute to yield loss due to weeds, including phytochrome-mediated changes in growth collectively called shade avoidance responses. Preliminary studies suggest shade avoidance can reduce Beta vulgaris yield up to 70%, even without direct competition for resources. This could lead to a fundamental shift in the current weed management paradigm, since no amount of added resources (like irrigation or fertilizer) could reverse the impact of shade avoidance responses caused by early season weeds. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the impact of weeds through greater understanding of the ecological processes that drive crop yield loss due to weeds. Using large-pot experiments under field conditions, we will (1) determine the growth stages during its life cycle that Beta vulgaris yield is affected by shade avoidance responses; (2) quantify the root to shoot ratio changes from shade-avoidance responses and subsequent impact on soil water use and competition between weeds and Beta vulgaris; and (3) use a process model-data fusion approach to test and improve predictions of crop yield loss from weed competition.

However, recent research has shown reductions in pest populations are also possible without consumption when pests engage in physiologically-costly defensive behaviors (i.e. non-consumptive effects). Therefore, any organism, whether another herbivore or a specialist predator of other prey, has the potential to reduce pest populations and contribute to biological control by disturbing the pest and causing defensive behaviors. The goal of my proposed predoctoral research study is to enhance the success of biological control efforts by exploring how other organisms in a community suppress pest populations through non-consumptive effects. Specifically, my objective is to determine whether organisms other than consumptive predators enhance suppression of aphids on fava beans in the field. In open field plots, I will determine whether increasing plant diversity with the incorporation of a collard intercrop in fava bean plots will attract a more diverse arthropod community composed of enemies and non-enemies of aphids, leading to greater aphid suppression through complementary consumptive and non-consumptive effects. These findings will demonstrate how other organisms in a community, not just predators, can contribute to biological control of pests. Understanding how non-consumptive effects of all organisms in a community most effectively suppress pest populations will increase crop health, leading to increases in crop yield, and therefore increases in food security.","The goal of my study is to determine if the incorporation of non-enemies into a parasitoid community can enhance herbivore suppression in an open cropping system.

Simply stated, no pregnancy, no milk, no money for the dairy producer. An overarching goal of our research is to provide further insight on the oocyte&#39;s role in pregnancy failure of heat-stressed cows. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that reductions in the developmental competence of the oocyte are due in large part to negative effects of heat stress on the oocyte, the cumulus cells that surround the oocyte, and the cells that make up the ovulatory follicle that contains the cumulus-enclosed oocyte. Depending upon the extent to which this may be occurring, the follicular fluid that bathes the oocyte may be altered in a manner to negatively impact the oocyte as it matures within the ovulatory follicle. This research effort has two specific objectives that will examine heat stress effects on the oocyte while it is surrounded by its protective nurse cells by 1) evaluating a factor that may be prematurely activated to cause certain processes to happen sooner than expected in the oocyte, and 2) determining the extent to which elevated body temperature perturbs cumulus and granulosa cell function in the ovulatory follicle to possibly impact the oocyte in a negative manner.

Most of the current antibiotics are not used in food animals to curb the problem of spreading drug-resistant pathogens and anti-viral agents are expensive to use on poultry. Fortunately, vaccination programs are available to combat many of the important pathogens that impact broilers during their short-lived cycle of production (~8 weeks). However, these vaccines do not provide sufficient control against emerging infections and most of them are not stable under field conditions.

In this project, our team of experts in nanotechnology, molecular biology, vaccines and poultry diseases will develop polyanhydride nanoparticle-based vaccines (i.e., nanovaccines) as a platform technology for more efficient poultry vaccination. Specifically, we will test the new technology in a model system with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causing infectious bronchitis (IB) disease, which results in severe economic losses to the poultry industry. Specifically, we will:Aim I: Examine the safety and fate of polyanhydrides (PANs) in chickens. We hypothesize that PANs will function as a safe and well-tolerated adjuvant for subunit vaccines in poultry. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize fluorescently labeled PANs to examine cell toxicity and tissue distribution in vivo. This aim will be successfully attained when the safety and persistence of PANs are well characterized in the target host for immunization, chickens.Aim II: Decipher the immunogenicity of IBV proteins encapsulated within PANs. We hypothesize that PANs will efficiently release IBV antigens throughout the lifespan of broilers (average 8 weeks). To test this hypothesis, IBV-encapsulated PANs will be used to immunize chicken and examine their immunogenicity over 8 weeks. This aim will be successfully attained when stable and sufficient release of IBV antigens is demonstrated from the PANs.Aim III: Analyze the protective immunity of polyanhydride nanovaccine against challenge with IBV. We hypothesize that the polyanhydride nanovaccine will provide a better immunization strategy than commercial live attenuated vaccines (LAV). To test this hypothesis, we will examine the protective efficacy of the nanovaccine in a standard model system of IBV in comparison to LAV using readouts that include clinical signs, histology, virus load, and immunological parameters. This aim will be successfully attained when the developed nanovaccine is shown to be more protective than LAV in the stringent IBV challenge model.

Decades of continuous use of manure as a fertilizer for crops and pasture production by AFOs has resulted in phosphorus saturation of soils, and consequently a major risk to water quality. Thus for animal production to continue in these areas, manure phosphorus management is required. Ideally, nutrient management in AFOs should consider a balanced whole farm approach that includes optimizing feed composition and manure treatment and use. Manure treatment to remove excess nutrients, particularly P, require selection and use of appropriate technologies. Our project will result in the development of a best management practice that will remove excess phosphorus in manure to help meet local watershed nutrient reduction goals from AFOs. For example, localities such as Shenandoah Valley, Virginia and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where dairy farming is a key economic driver but have to deal with the challenge of managing excess phosphorus in manure, would benefit from the technology we propose to develop. At the global scale, the availability of phosphorus in the future is being questioned as awareness increases about the declining quality and quantity of rock phosphate reserves that produce phosphorus used in agricultural production. Part of the proactive solutions being proposed to address the emerging phosphorus availability challenge is through recovery and reuse from materials like animal manure, to reduce the demand and reliance on phosphorus based fertilizer from phosphate rock. Thus, our proposed technology demonstration addresses both these local water quality goals and global phosphorus needs.We will use an integrated research and extension approach to achieve our goal. Planned activities include: working with stakeholders to develop, build, and evaluate a pilot scale system; conduct technology demonstrations; review outcomes with the stakeholders and plan how to move the technology forward. Finally, we will use the knowledge gained from the study to develop a continuing education program to improve manure nutrient management on dairy farms. Our approach is driven by the concept of designer manures we use as a basis to develop our technology. Designer manure is defined as a product with the appropriate balance of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer values that meet specific crop requirements. Additionally, we believe that to successfully deploy manure nutrient recovery technologies on farms, close coordination and strong partnerships with stakeholders is necessary, and above all, the technology must be practical, cost effective, and acceptable to the end users.Our goal is to develop and implement a robust chemical based phosphorus (P) recovery process from dairy manure. Specific objectives are: (1) build and test a pilot scale unit that combines solids separation, chemicals and process liquid to recover phosphorus from dairy manure and (2) develop an outreach program to enhance the dissemination and adoption of the technology developed. This technology will provide efficient stabilization and concentration and recovery of phosphorus in manure to enhance storage and/or off farm transport to regions with need for organic matter as a soil amendment and nutrient for crop production. If implemented on farms, the technology will (i) permit the continued use of manure as a fertilizer in areas that may be restricted by the phosphorus based manure application regulations and (ii) prevent over application of phosphorus, typically experienced when manure is applied to meet crop nitrogen needs. If we meet our goal, the work we propose will provide a system for recovering phosphorus from dairy manure and also generate knowledge to increase our understanding of on-farm phosphorus recovery from dairy manure. The technology would contribute to nutrient cleanup efforts in areas such as the Chesapeake Bay, if implemented on dairy farms in the watershed. The results of our project will also be available to the scientific community to use in tools for conducting life cycle assessment for dairy as well as developing phosphorus footprints of dairy products.","Our long term goal is to develop a robust chemical based phosphorus recovery technology as part of manure nutrient management on dairy farms through an integrated research and extension program.

In many tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide, the disease represents a major production constraint due to high temperatures, and high moisture. Infections usually result in leaf and fruit lesions, leaf defoliation, and yield loss of marketable fruits. In regions where the weather conditions are optimal for infection and spread of the disease, bacterial spot disease has been estimated to cause yield losses of up to 50%. Monetary losses due to bacterial spot in southwest Florida alone were estimated at $3,090 per acre based on 2007-08 production costs and market value.Currently, management options for this disease are quite limited. Chemical treatments using the antibiotic streptomycin was successfully used in 1950s. As strains developed resistance to streptomycin in due course, the antibiotic becameineffective andcopper (Cu)-based bactericides became the chemical of choice for disease management. However, as a result of repeated applications and continuous use, Cu resistance in bacterial spot strainsis nowadays the norm.To overcome this, we propose touse advances in nanotechnology tointroduce a new disease management strategy for bacterial spot of tomato. We will focus on materials innovation to develop a locally-systemic pesticide that will exhibit higher efficiency against Cu resistant bacteria, even at concentrations that are markedlylower than the current best practices, thereforereducing impact of Cu accumulation in the environment.The interdisciplinary team will (1)develop industrially-viable bi-modallocally-systemic pesticideformulations efficient to target Cu resistant bacterial strains, (2)evaluate efficacy of thelocally-systemic pesticideand grower standard against Cu-resistant bacteriain vitroand tomato bacterial spot disease in greenhouse and field conditions,and(3)perform high resolution structural, subsurface imaging and spectroscopy studies to measure distribution and composition oflocally-systemic pesticideand grower standard in plant tissues.The fundamental understanding of the nanoparticle-bacteria interactions and their effect on plants at the molecular as well as at the system level will have a strong impact on plant science and sustainable agriculture, providing a strong experimental framework for the nascent field of material innovation for sustainable agriculture.","The overall goal of this project is to use advances in nanotechnology to design and develop novel Locally-Systemic Pesticide (LSP) particle for improving efficacy of Cu bactericides against Cu resistant plant pathogens and reducing impact of Cu accumulation in the environment. To achieve this we will push the boundaries of nanometrology to enable measuring LSP particle distribution and composition in plant tissue at the molecular/nanoscale level.This proposal introduces a novel concept of developing LSP particles and will meet at least two program objectives. (i) Innovative ideas/fundamental science and (ii) Enhanced crop protection/food security. The optimized LSP formulation composition (including active and inerts) will contain chemicals, which are EPA approved for ""Food Use"" only. If successful, the LSP technology will revolutionize the agriculture industry by providing powerful tools to farmers for combating ""difficult to manage"" bacterial diseases such as tomato bacterial spot.Specific objectives are:Task 1: Develop industrially-viable bi-modal LSP formulations containing mixed-valence Cu nanoparticles and Quaternary Ammonium compound (Quat) (Santra)We will (1) synthesize silica ""seed"" particles of three different sizes (50 - 100 nm, 100 - 300 nm and 400 - 600 nm) using St&ouml;ber sol-gel method with some modifications; (2) grow Cu loaded silica shell using our previously published synthesis protocol with further modifications to create mixed-valence Cu; (3) apply Quat coating over the mixed-valence core-shell Cu loaded silica nanoparticles to obtain the proposed LSP particles.All LSP formulations will be characterized for size distribution, morphology and composition using standard analytical techniques (FE-SEM, AFM, DLS, XPS, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, TGA and DTA, and AAS).To evaluate plant tissue damage (phytotoxicity) potential of the LSP materials, in growth chamber, plants will be sprayed with LSP test samples. Plants will be monitored for potential tissue damage for one week.Rainfastness of LSP formulations will be evaluated by spraying the LSP formulation on tomato plants until it runs off. Once dried, plant will beexposed to a series of rain conditions. Next, leaves and fruits will be collected to quantify the concentration of metallic Cu using AAS and Quat selective chemical assay.Task 2: Evaluate in vitro efficacy of LSP and grower standard against Cu-resistant X. perforans (Santra, Paret, Jones)In this task, preliminary antibacterial efficacy studies will be done for screening a series of LSP formulationsusing Turbidity assay and Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA)and determine the MIC values. We will then select 2-3 most promising candidates for evaluating efficacy in greenhouse and field conditions.CFU assays will be used to study two X. perforans strains, GEV485 (Cu-resistant) and 91-118 (Cu-sensitive), isolated from tomato in Florida. The effect of treatments including LSP at 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ppm and copper prepared from Kocide&reg; 3000 at 1000 ppm will be compared.Task 3: Evaluate efficacy of LSP and controls against tomato bacterial spot disease in greenhouse and field conditions (Paret, Jones)The following treatments will be used: 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ppm of LSP; Kocide&reg; 3000 (2.1 g/liter) by itself, a combination of Kocide&reg; 3000 (2.1 g/liter) and Penncozeb&reg; 75DF (United Phosphorus, Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA; 1.2 g/liter); and sterile tap water. We will use 16 plants per treatment in each experiment and the experiment will be repeated twice. The LSP materials and control suspensions will be applied as foliar sprays onto both the underside and upper sides of three to four week old Bonnie Best tomato leaves until run off and will be allowed to dry thoroughly before bacterial inoculation. Cu-resistant X. perforans strain GEV485 will be used in the greenhouse experiments. The bacterial suspension will be prepared and sprayed onto both sides of the tomato leaves. The inoculated seedlings will be then placed in plastic bags to maintain high humidity for 48 h. The bags will be carefully removed and the inoculated plants will be rated using the Horsfall-Barratt disease severity scale every other day for 14 days. The area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) will be then calculated by directly taking the midpoint of the percent ranges for each disease severity value.The effective LSP from greenhouse experiments will be tested on field grown tomatoes based on methods established by the co-PIs. Five field trials will be conducted in Florida in Spring of 2016, 2017, 2018 and Fall of 2015 and 2016 at the University of Florida North Florida Research and Education Center in Quincy, FL. Experimental plots will consist of fumigated raised beds covered with white polyethylene mulch. Plots will be maintained throughout the season using standard fertility, irrigation, and crop protection practices recommended for commercial tomato production in Florida. Inorganic fertilizers will be applied to experimental plots based on soil test results and cooperative extension recommendations. Seedlings of &#39;BHN 602&#39; (BHN Seeds, Immokalee, FL), a bacterial spot susceptible variety will be used for the study. Each entry will consist of 5 replications with 18 plants in each replication. The plants will be sprayed in the early morning at weekly intervals (8 times) starting from 2nd week after transplanting. Disease severity will be rated at weekly intervals using the Horsfall-Barratt scale, to assess the percentage of canopy affected by bacterial spot. Twelve plants from the center of each plot will be marked, and fruit will be harvested from these plants 2 to 3 times during the trial at a mature green/early breaker stage typical of tomato production in Florida and graded based on USDA Grades. Leaves and fruits will be examined for phytotoxicity during the experiment and rated (see Task 4).Task 4: Perform high resolution structural, subsurface imaging and spectroscopy studies to measure distribution and composition of LSP and controls in plant tissue (Tetard, Santra)Tomato plants will be grown in Dr. Santra&#39;s lab to use for our optimization of the platform. Later in the project, tomato tissues will be provided from field efficacy trials coordinated by Drs. Santra and Paret. Optimization of sectioning of plant tissue cross sections for high resolution analysis will be performed. This step is critical to access the nanoscale feature inside the plant cell wall. We will use a custom-made microtome to section fresh plant samples without the need to freeze, fix or embed the tissues.We will use confocal Raman microscopy as a preliminary screening of the samples to screen large areas of plant tissues to identify changes in plant structure, composition or indicators of nanoparticle presence.We will use high resolution imaging to study possible changes in morphology of the NPs and plant tissues, as well as possible changes in composition of the NPs and plant tissues. We will especially focus on the advancing the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in nanoparticle uptake for locally systemic activity, phytotoxicity and the effect of rainfastness treatments on the plant leaves and fruits.","copper, pesticide, tomato, Copper-tolerant, Locally-systemic, Quat, X. perforans"

Although Verticillium wilts are primarily managed through rotations with asymptomatic hosts, the efficacy of these rotations has been extremely inconsistent depending on the field and/or growing region. The research proposed here intends to be proof-of-concept that one mechanism by which an asymptomatic rotational crop such as oat can impact disease severity in a subsequent potato crop is through a change or shift in the pathogen population composition. This genotypic shift results from the endophytic interaction between the asymptomatic host and the pathogen. To address this hypothesis we will use a combination of field, microbiological and genetic analyses. Replicated field microplots will be infested with specific mixtures of V. dahliae genotypes and subjected to an oat-potato rotation. We will then monitor shifts in genotypic diversity due to the endophytic interaction of the fungus with the asymptomatic rotational crop oat. The genotype shift in soil V. dahliae populations will be identified based on the quantification of the frequencies of the genotypes present in soil based on Illumina sequencing of SNPs diagnostic for each genotype. We will also monitor disease development to make correlations between genotype shifts and disease suppression.","The goal of this proposal is to bring a scientific perspective to the role of rotations in disease management based on an in-depth understanding of the interactions between the pathogen (in our case, Verticillium dahliae) and plant species, so that new sustainable and environmentally-friendly management practices based on ad hoc rotations can be designed.The specific objective of this research is to test whether oat as an asymptomatic rotational crop impacts the soil population structure of Verticillium dahliae resulting in a genotypic shift that affects disease development in a subsequent potato crop.","crop rotation, disease management, endophytes, population dynamics, verticillium, asymptomatic host"

The Great Plains represents the focal region based on its diversity of agricultural systems, varied exposures to projected climate change, and importance to U.S. agriculture. We will emphasize two major agricultural production systems and their primary subcomponents: 1) beef cattle, including cow-calf and stocker operations, and 2) crop systems, including corn, wheat (spring and winter) and soybean production. The approach is based on an assessment of relevant, currently available data that draws from numerous sources that will be assessed by an experienced and diverse research team to create a first generation assessment framework. This framework will inform policy makers and other stakeholders of potential vulnerabilities and guide adaptation planning for agricultural systems throughout the Great Plains. This framework can be adapted for use throughout the U.S. by populating it with data from various agricultural regions.","The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a climate change assessment framework by linking the vulnerability components of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to support agricultural decision-making and policy development to minimize agricultural vulnerability to climate change.

Humans can purposefully enhance or reduce biodiversity at many levels within agricultural landscapes. While studies have evaluated the roles of plant and insect biodiversity on ecological processes, such as production and pollination, little research to date has explored effects of plant-microbe symbiotic diversity on agroecosystem functionality, in part because it is difficult, if not impossible, to experimentally control plant-microbe interactions in the field. Utilizing the well-characterized grass – vertically transmitted fungal endophyte system, we will explore whether community-level symbiotic diversity influences managed cool-season pasture ecosystem services, including yield, forage quality, plant and insect diversity, soil-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas emissions, and soil carbon sequestration. Tall fescue is a dominant forage grass of the eastern half of the U.S., covers significant acreage, and often hosts the fungal endophyte, Epichloë coenophiala. Presence and genetic strain of the endophyte can be manipulated, and several fescue cultivars containing different strains of E. coenophiala or entirely endophyte-free are available to producers today. Seed lots consist of a population of fescue, but when endophyte-infected, typically only one strain of endophyte is present within a labeled cultivar. Therefore, planted fescue pastures tend to have low endophyte symbiotic diversity. We hypothesize that increasing endophyte symbiotic diversity within the tall fescue community will enhance pasture provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services.

Population growth and non-existent land-expansion opportunities within the city are driving municipal discussions for alternative means to expand the land application system (LAS) capacity in rural Onslow County. Because municipal wastewater LAS are an undefined source of COC entry into soils and waters, non-targeted screening and targeted screening will provide characterization of chemicals in the wasteater for hazard identification. Field measurements in the watershed will define wastewater composition in groundwater and surface waters around the facility and off-site of the facility.These data will be used to estimate risk to humans from exposure to groundwate or surface waters. Project activities will be developed with a communityParticipatory Leadership Group (PLG). Findings will be shared with this group as well as aCommunity Involvement Group (CIG) to understand public perceptions of current, non-traditional wastewater use and risks, public values and perceptions for alternative water reuse in the future, and appropriate strategies to communicate these findings to the broader public. Project findings will be integrated as modules into graduate and undergraduate capstone courses. Requested funds will support community engagement training for a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate research internships as shared appointments between the USEPA and NC State.","Our major goal is tounderstand human exposure pathways and potential human health risks of organic chemical contaminants in nontraditional agricultural water, specifically secondary-treated municipal wastewater that is spray-irrigated onto forestedlands in coastal North Carolina. Our project goals are to characterize chemical contaminants of concern (COCs) and their human health risks of land-applied, secondary municipal wastewater in a forested system and to translate research to decision makers and communities to better understand community values and perceptions of alternative wastewater reuse to other agricultural lands.Our collaborative effort will support the following objectives: (1) utilize state of the art mass spectrometry to characterize potential organic chemical contaminants of concern (COC) in the LAS system (effluent, reservoir, irrigation effluent, groundwaters, soils, and surface waters) in collaboration with M. Strynar (USEPA); (2) expand existing hydrology research at the site to quantify wastewater composition in watershed surface and groundwaters using hydrometric measurements and stable water isotope analyses; (3) integrate data from chemical and hydrological characterization to determine primary exposure pathways of human exposure and health risks associated with those exposures; (4) recruit and engage a community involvement group (CIG) to evaluate community perceptions and values for current and alternative wastewater use and best approaches for public dissemination of findings; and (5) educate and train the next generation of scientists and decision makers by integrating project findings into three NC State courses, training undergraduates via summer research internships, and training the post-doctoral researcher in interdisciplinary engagement.","wastewater, human exposure, pine-hardwood forest"

To accomplish these goals, we will pair novel techniques (Nextgen sequencing-based gut analysis, ELISA-based quantification of neonicotinoid seed treatments, and colorometric assays to assess nutritional status) with traditional population assessments and laboratory bioassays. Conservation strips will be planted next to untreated cornfields. Nutritional and reproductive status and dietary breadth of honey bees in response to the conservation strips will be determined. Bioassays will be used to test the susceptibility of nutritionally stressed honey bees to acute and sublethal effects of clothianidin in the laboratory. Finally, health and nutrition of honey bees collected from conservation strips adjacent to clothianidin seed-treated cornfields will be assessed. The study system (conservation strips and neonicotinoids) ensures the research is particuarly relevant to stakeholders, and will provide a comprehensive and realistic assessment of how nutritional stress and pesticide risk can be mitigated with plant diversity in the landscape.

Semiochemicals are used as defensive weapons, to signal danger, to mark resources for later foraging or for avoidance, and to identify mates of the correct species and assess their quality. An understanding of how chemical communication operates requires analysis of both signal production and signal perception.The social insects take this chemosensory lifestyle to an extreme. The sophisticated division of labor that typifies eusociality requires exquisite regulation of individual behaviors, and chemical signals are crucial for organizing work within the colony. Of the social insects, ants rely most heavily on chemical signaling, and the research in my lab has been leading the way in identifying some of the most important pheromonal controls of ant behavior.The complex behaviors of ants also make them some of the most serious agricultural pests. The invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), which displays an extreme form of sociality, is a particularly widespread and damaging insect pest, and is considered one of the 100 most damaging invasive species world-wide. Because of this, the Argentine ant is also one of the most well-studied ants - it was one of the first to have its genome sequenced, and our analyses have revealed a number of genes that are likely involved in the production and perception of key chemical signals. Moreover, our recent studies have led to the discovery of several important chemical signals used by Argentine ants for biological processes such as queen production, foraging, recruitment, and the recognition of nestmates and non-nestmates.For this research project, I will use a functional genetic approach to illuminate how chemical signals are both produced and perceived by insects, using the invasive Argentine ant as a model system.We have developed an RNA interference (RNAi) treatment protocol for Argentine ants, and will use it to knock down expression of genes involved in both the production and reception of the chemical signals. Following RNAi-mediated knockdown of target genes, we will quantify differences in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons and focal behaviors. After silencing genes for pheromone biosynthesis, we will quantify the consequences for 1) cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, 2) nestmate recognition behavior, and 3) queen recognition behavior. For the chemosensory gene knock downs, we will quantify changes in 1) nestmate recognition ability, 2) queen recognition behavior, and 3) trail following (recruitment) behavior.","The major goals of the proposed research are to use chemical ecological, functional genetic, and behavioral approaches to illuminate the genetic architecture of pheromone production and pheromone perception in the widespread and damaging Argentine ant (Linepithema humile).

They regulate cell division and metabolism, delay senescence, and play a role in biotic and abiotic stresses. Significantly, they also regulate root architecture in monocots such as rice, root growth and architecture being of critical importance for the ability of the plant to acquire water and nutrients. The main goal of this project is to determine the role cytokinin plays in controlling the root system architecture. This goal will be accomplished through examining the role that a key family of cytokinin-regulated transcription factors play in controlling root growth. Mutants in these transcription factors will be examined for their effects on the root architecture. In addition, the direct targets for these transcription factors will be determined, as these are likely play a key role in the means by which cytokinin regulates that root system architecture. The proposed project addresses an agronomically important process with the potential for improving crop productivity.","Much of what we know of cytokinin action comes from studies in Arabidopsis. Comparatively little is known about its function in such economically important monocots as rice, wheat, and maize. This project will provide critical information about cytokinin action in the agronomically important monocot rice, which exhibits substantially different root system architecture (RSA) than that found in Arabidopsis.The main goal of this project is to determine the role cytokinin plays in controlling RSA. This goal will be accomplished through examining the role that type-B response regulators play in regulating RSA, type-B response regulators being the transcription factors that regulate the expression of cytokinin response genes.

PROJECT,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE,1008804,2016-67015-24914,The role of host genetic resistance and vaccination on transmission of Marek's disease virus in poultry,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,460000.0,"Dunn, JO, R..",ACTIVE,"Despite major advances in controlling Marek&#39;s disease (MD) by genetic resistance and vaccination, history suggests that the virus will likely evolve towards higher virulence, which will eventually lead to another disease outbreak. Thus, this proposal addresses the critical need for a long-term and sustainable solution to stop or slow down the cycle of viral evolution to higher virulence in order to delay the need to develop and introduce a new set of more effective vaccines. The ultimate goal is not only to select for reduced disease incidence and improved MD vaccines but also for breeders and vaccine manufacturers to select for reduced virus transmission, in order to reduce virus load in the environment and lower the opportunity for virus evolution.We plan to achieve these goals through a series of experiments that determine infectivity of donor birds based on response of contact recipient birds. In Objectives 1 &amp; 2, we examine 1) how long recipient birds need to be exposed to a virus-shedding donor bird to allow infection of the recipient birds, 2) initiation and duration of donor virus transmission for multiple genetic backgrounds and vaccinations, 3) the effect of host genetics and vaccination on infectivity using many replicates to achieve adequate statistical power, and 4) determination of whether MD genetic resistance or MD vaccines significantly alter FFE viral load. Samples to be collected include feathers from donor and recipient birds at multiple time points, as well as blood from recipient birds. The thousands of samples collected will not only allow us to determine when recipient birds become infected, we can also determine if viral load in donor feathers can serve as a proxy indicator of infectivity. If one assumes that reducing viral load in the poultry house is relevant for sustainable MD control, by reducing the likelihood that more virulent MDV strains will emerge, then one of the major challenges will be how to select birds or vaccines for reduced transmission. Objective 3 further dissects the relationship between genetic resistance and viral load in FFE in order to provide initial insights about genetic regions potentially associated with virus transmission. These insights will allow future genetic selection to be made for both reduced disease incidence and reduced virus transmission.We believe this work will generate crucial understanding of how vaccination and host genetics influence MD spread in poultry populations. The resulting information will provide breeders, biologic companies, and policy makers with new sustainable opportunities for practical interventions to control MD by targeting both of the key epidemiological traits affecting disease risk and severity in poultry populations: host resistance and infectivity. The long-term goals of this study, by identifying phenotypic and ultimately genetic markers for reduced virus transmission, are to reduce environmental virus load and thus increase existing and future vaccine efficacy. We believe that the tools and insights for assessing the relationship between host resistance and infectivity will be useful for other types of infectious diseases in different species.","Marek&#39;s disease (MD), a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by the highly pathogenic Marek&#39;s disease virus (MDV) is one of the most serious chronic disease problems that costs the worldwide poultry industry $1-2 billion per year. Efforts to control this agriculturally relevant disease have focused on biosecurity, vaccination, and selection for genetic resistance. However, there is a lack of epidemiological studies that examine how the virus is spread from bird-to-bird. In particular, it is not known whether current control efforts also reduce transmission of MDV. Transmission and spread of an infectious agent like MDV depends on both (1) how susceptible non-infected individuals are, and (2) the infectivity or propensity of transmitting the infection. There is evidence for considerable phenotypic variation in infectivity for many pathogens, which may also have a genetic component. Up to now, however, obtaining reliable estimates for host genetic infectivity has proven difficult as appropriate quantitative genetics methods were lacking. We have recently developed the theoretical framework and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that allow us to estimate host (genetic) susceptibility and infectivity from binary disease data. In this project we will apply these to MD in poultry. Our US-UK collaborative approach to this project will leverage our US scientists&#39; expertise in MD pathogenesis complemented by our UK collaborators&#39; expertise with statistical tools and immune genetics.In this proposal, we hypothesize that poultry vaccinated against MD and with greater genetic resistance to MD are also less infectious, and we address the following objectives.Determine to what extent poultry are less infectious using pairs of chicken lines that vary greatly in genetic resistance to MD via MHC or non-MHC genes as well as how this correlates with viral load in FFE.Determine to what extent vaccination against MD also reduces infectivity.Further characterize the relationship between MDV load in FFE and MD genetic resistance as well as whether FFE viral load can be used as a biomarker using defined chicken lines derived from the parental lines that vary significantly in non-MHC genetic resistance.","Marek`s disease, chicken, genetics, infectivity, transmission"

Genome wide association studies have identified thousands of loci linked to agriculturally important traits; however in most cases the causal gene remains unknown. Assessing a single data type can often miss complex models that require variation across multiple levels of biological regulation. Integrating several sources of unbiased, genomic information allows for efficient ranking of interesting candidate regions discovered by GWAS.We propose building tools to integrate available sources of genomic data in the horse to build a multi-staged data integration model for prioritization of QTL candidate genes. Using these tools, we will investigate Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) in a disease specific (case-control) meta-dimensional model by integrating whole genome SNP data, muscle and adipose RNAseq, and metabolomic data from horses phenotyped for EMS.We hypothesize an integrated, network based approach will better explain the genotype to phenotype relationship of EMS than any single dataset alone. Linking phenotype to causal genes is critical to understanding the biology underlying traits, and in the context of disease, the identification of potential preventative measures and therapeutic targets.The results of this study have the potential to substantially expand our understanding of the molecular and genetic factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of EMS, and improve our ability to predict disease risk. Furthermore, since this approach is generalizable to any phenotype of interest, our long term goal is to develop tools that allow integration of genomic and other high-dimensional datasets to better understand complex phenotypic traits and extend them to other agricultural animals.

Student, faculty and community demand for these programs, and the pressing childhood obesity prevention need, drive the rationale for the education objectives in the Growing Strong Generations project, which build on discussions started in 2011 about designing degree pathways in public and community health sciences.The Growing Strong Generations project is significant because it 1) works to prevent childhood obesity by including food system approaches that provide access to food and resources to consume it, 2) leverages assets available in many American Indian reservations and other communities, making the intervention more scalable and transferable, and 3) develops and assesses childhood obesity prevention strategies, as well as develops capacity, in collaboration with Native American communities, which have the earliest mortality and highest obesity rates of any ethnic group for children in the U.S.","In Growing Strong Generations we propose to design and test the viability of an intervention to improve healthy eating among children in Flathead Indian reservation through out-of-school programming while increasing the capacity of the local tribal college to support such interventions.Native American youth are at most risk of childhood obesity in the US. Out-of-school programming offers a promising way to reach children with obesity interventions since over 8.4 million US youth participate out-of-school programming.These programs serve a high proportion of ""at-risk"" children without competing with school academic content. However, the effectiveness of such programs on obesity risk has not been well established.Further, out-of-school programs often have limited connections with local food systems and parents are rarely involved, though both may increase the impact of such programming on child nutritional health.Since 2012, the University of Montana (UM) and Salish-Kootenai College (SKC) have been collaborating on efforts to decrease obesity risk among children through existing out-of-school programs. Preliminary data from our activities suggests our approaches may positively impact children&#39;s nutrition knowledge and parent support of children&#39;s healthy eating. We have found that important barriers to child healthy eating are access to locally produced healthy foods and resources to facilitate their consumption. We have also found that limited capacity of SKC in arenas of nutrition and community health has constrained our ability to tackle these barriers.We propose to develop a culturally appropriate set of intervention modules for out-of-school programming use, with greater integration of families and food system approaches, and to evaluate their viability (including acceptability and scalability). We also aim to increase SKC&#39;s capacity to train students in gardening, food systems, and program evaluation.The specific objectives of this project are to:Design a set of culturally-relevant intervention modules that will improve gardening and accessing healthy foods knowledge and skills in children enrolled in out-of-school programs. (Research)Evaluate the viability of these modules for use in out-of-school programming. (Research)Increase the capacity of SKC students and staff to implement and evaluate intervention strategies for gardening, accessing healthy foods, and preparing and consuming locally produced foods. (Education)Reaching these three objectives will provide our team with the pilot data and the professional capacity to design and propose a rigorous effectiveness evaluation to AFRI in 2018. That project will enable us to reach the long-term goal of Growing Strong Generations: to reduce childhood obesity and improve child healthy eating through scalable, sustainable and culturally appropriate out-of-school programming interventions.","education, native american, nutrition, obesity prevention, research, Overweight prevention"
PROJECT,SAES - CORNELL UNIVERSITY,1008905,2016-67023-24817,"Food Waste: Consumer Response to Information, Technology, and Risk",National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499990.0,"Rickard, BR, J.",ACTIVE,"The presence of food waste, and ways to reduce food waste, has generated significant debate among industry stakeholders, policy makers, and consumer groups. Arguably, food waste has become one of the top issues for individuals and organizations involved in food marketing and food policy in the United States and elsewhere. The U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development acknowledges food waste and food loss as important components of food insecurity in their Zero Hunger Challenge. In June 2013, the USDA and the EPA partnered to launch the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, an initiative to reduce food waste throughout the food supply chain. Some have estimated that annual food waste costs in the United States are approximately $160 billion, representing resources that went into the production, distribution, and marketing of food products. Food waste is also a food security concern as it symbolizes a lost opportunity to feed the 17.5 million (14.3%) food insecure U.S. households.Researchersestimate that 31 percent of food is wasted; this is the total of food wasted by consumers (21 percent) and producers (10 percent). Because the largest share of food waste is associated with consumers, and because there are several efforts underway to address food waste issues in the production, distribution, and storage stages, we propose to examine opportunities for interventions to reduce household food waste by better understanding consumer behavior. Specifically, we propose to examine how consumers respond to information and technologies that may have the potential to affect the level of food waste. As part of thisresearch, we will also quantify current levels of food waste and to simulate how policy alternatives may influence food waste in the United States.Our research involvesfour-stages. In the first stage, we will develop a conceptual model to assess the frequency and magnitude of food consumption and food waste by consumers. As part of this exercise, the model will be developed to consider how information and technology will affect the appropriate measures of food consumption and food waste. In experimental settings, economists have developed well-documented and incentive compatible methods to collect prices from consumers, but the methods for evaluating food consumption (and food waste) by consumers are not as clearly defined. In the second stage we will design a laboratory experiment and use it to collect data describing how consumers respond to information about various date labels for a range of packaged food products. In the third stage we will develop a follow-up experiment to collect data that shows how consumers&#39; food waste habits can be influenced by technologies that may impact food consumption for fresh products. Here we are interested specifically in the proposed and recently deregulated GE technologies that are being promoted as products that may lead to less food waste. Both experiments will also collect detailed information to assess risk attitudes and preferences among subjects as a way to better understand the effects of information and technology on food waste patterns among consumers. In the fourth stage we will employ the empirical findings from the two experiments in a multi-market simulation model to simulate how information and/or technologies aiming to reduce food waste will affect welfare for stakeholders in the supply chain.","The primary gaolof this researchis to determine how the amount of food waste by consumers is influenced by specific types of information and technology. In achieving this objective we also fulfill the following seven sub-goals:To develop a conceptual model of food consumption and food waste that will allow for an accurate measurement of food waste in an experimental setting and for subsequent empirical estimation and policy simulation workTo design an experiment that collects data on the effects of various date labels on food waste among a range of consumers with varying preferences for riskTo estimate an econometric model that identifies the effects of specific data labels for specific packaged food productsTo design a second experiment that collects data on the effects of GE technology--coupled with negative and/or positive information about such technologies--on food waste across a range of consumers with varying preferences for riskTo estimate an econometric model that identifies the effects of GE technology on consumers&#39; intake patterns (and food waste) for fresh food productsTo simulate the welfare effects from food waste mitigation policies that impact product label information or product availabilityTo use the results of the conceptual and empirical analyses to shed new light on food consumption and food waste patterns among selected populations, and to help better understand the likely impacts of the use of information and technology on food waste patternsBy fulfilling these goals, we will address a critical gap in our understanding of how much food is wasted, and if food waste differs largely across product categories, across product sizes, and across different populations (including populations differentiated by risk attitudes and preferences). Furthermore, studying these goalswill lead us towards a better understanding of how different strategies that aim to reduce food waste might affect consumer behavior and ultimately affect the level of food waste across a range of consumers.","consumer behavior, genetically engineered crops, policy analysis, simulation, Food waste, date labels"

Streptococcus suis causes more than $100 million dollars in annual losses to the US pork industry. Treatment is usually via antibiotics that are often expensive and can yield resistant strains. S. suis is a rare zoonotic pathogen and when it does infect humans, is often lethal (20% fatalities in recent episodes). This application describes the development of novel antimicrobials based on bacteriophage (phage) lytic proteins (bacteriophage are bacterial viruses that lyse bacteria). Phage lytic enzymes are highly refractory to resistance development, likely due to the co-evolution of host and phage. To further reduce resistant strain development, this proposal describes the engineering of triple-acting cell wall degrading proteins with three unique, simultaneous, lytic activities. In addition to in vitro testing of biofilm eradication by the triple-acting antimicrobials, this work proposes to develop several porcine models of S. suis infection/colonization: nasal, blood stream and vaginal colonization (outside the funding of this project). In vivo studies will include: 1) microbiomics to identify the effect of the novel antimicrobials on non-targeted commensal strains, 2) pharmacokinetics to determine the half-life of the engineered enzymes in blood stream, and 3) antigenicity testing to verify pig antibodies against the triple-acting enzymes do not neutralize the antimicrobial action and that the proinflammatory proteins released from lysed S. suis do not cause a deleterious immune response. Each model will be tested for resistant strains by screening the S. suis isolates that survive the treatment for their susceptibility to the triple-acting agents.","Antimicrobials with reduced resistance development are essential to both human and animal health. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat or prevent bacterial diseases, and in food-producing animals to improve feed efficiency.However, antibiotics have numerous unintended or collateral effects, including killing non-target beneficial microbes.These beneficial microbes are the host organism&#39;s co-evolved partners and are an essential component of host health. Resistance to antibiotics is a concern in the clinic and on the farm because of the potential for farm-to-clinic resistance transfers. There is increasing pressure to limit antibiotic use in agriculture, and to identify acceptable alternatives to antibiotics for use in food animal production. Increases in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus suis strains worldwide is presumably due to widespread veterinary use of antibiotics. Notably, peptidoglycan hydrolase (PGH) enzymes for the prevention or treatment of infectious disease have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic usage. The non-antibiotic nature of PGH antimicrobials has many advantages: 1) near pathogen-specificity helps avoid the concerns associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics; 2) active on multi-drug resistant forms of the pathogen; 3) active on senescent and biofilm forms of the pathogen; 4) non-toxic, non-caustic, and biodegradable; and 5) as enzymes, PGHs can attack the multiple cell wall sites. This proposal will develop pathogen-specific antimicrobials against S. suis that are highly refractory to resistance development (via a strategy that should be applicable to any Gram-positive pathogen).Aim 1. Identify components and develop triple-acting antimicrobials to eradicate S. suis. Aim 2. Characterize triple fusion constructs. Aim 3. Demonstrate triple-acting PGH efficacy in vivo with S. suis infected/colonized pigs. ","peptidoglycan hydrolase, Streptococcus suis, triple-acting antimicrobial"

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide worldwide and &gt;30 weed species have evolved resistance to it. Our proposal combines methods from weed science, evolutionary ecology, and molecular biology to address novel questions about how weeds evolve under increasing selection pressure from glyphosate. Ouroverall goal is to determine whether glyphosate-resistant biotypes exhibit underlying fitness effects in the absence of herbicide treatment. For horseweed (Conyza canadensis), studies will be carried out in Ohio and Iowa. Glyphosate resistant horseweed was reported in Ohio in 2002 and in Iowa 8 years later. Many biotypes are now resistant to 20X the initial field rate. We plan to: 1) characterize variation in glyphosate resistance for 240 biotypes (maternal families); 2) test for overexpression of EPSPS as a mechanism of resistance; 3) test for fitness differences among 60 susceptible and 60 resistant biotypes in field experiments; and 4) compare parent-offspring resistance levels in self-pollinating lines. As a complement to our work with horseweed, we have developed transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana that overexpress EPSPS and are resistant to glyphosate. We plan to assess specific fitness effects of overproducing EPSPS in single- and multi-generation greenhouse experiments, taking advantage of the plant&#39;s short life cycle. We are an experienced team with promising preliminary results from the past two years.

In addition, concentrations of micronutrients such as Fe are lost during grain processing. We propose that bacterial inoculants could be used to simultaneously increase Fe and decrease As concentrations in rice, and we have identified a novel, nonpathogenic, naturally-occurring rice-rhizospheric bacterial candidate for this purpose.

We propose that bacterial inoculants could be used to simultaneously increase Fe and decrease As concentrations in rice, and we have identified a novel, nonpathogenic, naturally-occurring rice-rhizospheric bacterial candidate for this purpose. In our preliminary experiments, inoculation of rice with this unique strain resulted in increased Fe and decreased As accumulation in rice shoots. This bacterium (hereafter EA106) is a Pantoea species strain that also demonstrated increased Fe-siderophore activity in culture and improved rice growth in the presence of As. The enhanced accumulation of Fe in the roots and the adjacent root plaques within the rhizospheric soil suggests that colonization of rice root with EA106 improves Fe uptake and promotes the formation of a more oxidative environment in the rhizosphere, thereby allowing more expansive Fe plaque formation, which sequesters As. Our preliminary data also shows that EA106 leads to increased shoot and grain Fe levels. Therefore, this microbe has the potential to increase food quality through the enrichment of the essential nutrient iron and the reduction of the concentration of toxic arsenic species within the edible portions of the plant. However, it is unclear how the plant, bacterium and rhizospheric chemistry interact to control Fe and As concentrations in the plant. Are there specific biochemical events that are restricted to specific organelles for translocation of non-toxic forms of As? How does EA106 simultaneously increase Fe yet restrict As uptake in roots? We aim to use the microbes to increase Fe and decrease As uptake in rice. Specifically: we will assess how EA106 and other rhizospheric strains isolated from rice can be used to simultaneously increase Fe and decrease As uptake in rice in arsenic rich conditions. Specifically we will 1) determine the micronutrient composition of rice grown +/- these microbes; 2) monitor the impact of microbial treatment on arsenic speciation and content in rice plants; 3) understand the role of EA106 in altering plant-availability of iron and arsenic to rice roots in rice paddy mesocosms. This proposal will integrate the governing Fe and As chemistry with the genomics of host, and beneficial microbe in a tritrophic interaction. If successful, seeds with decreased As and increased Fe concentrations should also lead to agronomic benefits such as increased seedling vigor, reduced health hazards and improved Fe nutrition.

At present, weeds have evolved resistance to 22 of the 25 known herbicide sites of action. Herbicide resistance is now reported to affect 247 plant species worldwide. Added to this problem is the lack of new chemistries on the market targeting different modes of action. In response to the worldwide concern of herbicide resistance in cropping systems, we are developing new methodologies to uncover novel compounds isolated from soil microorganisms that could be effective in weed management.The set of methods focuses on recovering soil samples collected from root zones of different agronomically important weeds showing growth inhibition. Large fragments of DNA are extracted from the soil and inserted into vectors that hold the DNA fragments within a host bacterial cell. Replication of the bacterial hosts provides additional copies of the DNA fragments, which facilitate high throughput screening of regions of DNA coding for the synthesis of compounds of interest. Bacteria containing the relevant DNA fragments are grown for compound extraction. The compounds are then examined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance technologies for compound identification.  Once compounds are retested and reconfirmed for weed inhibition, we are able to use the sequence structure as a marker to screen for soils having the weed-suppressive compounds. We can then design a set of experiments to understand management strategies associated with the enrichment of these weed-suppressive compounds. Further down the road, we hope to develop microbial-based manipulations of soils that would control weedy and invasive plant populations. The set of methodologies are useful for the development of both novel herbicides and could also lead to biological control involving soil management strategies that enrich for weed-suppressive compounds.","The goal of the project is to set the groundwork for integrating metagenomics approaches to compound discovery in the study of plant-microbe interactions impacting weed populations. There is a strong need to develop new tools in weed ecology research, and our proposed work would provide the proof of concept needed to bridge the skillsets of microbiologists and weed scientists. A good example of this collaboration would entail weed scientists providing samples of weed suppressive soils to microbiologists who would generate metagenomic libraries and analyze them for compounds of interest. Further collaboration from natural products chemists would allow for more detailed compound analysis. Once this pipeline is streamlined, largely by our proposed work, we would be able to move forward with proposing multi-species and cross-regional analysis of agronomic species of interest to the weed science community. An ideal outcome of the project is to begin building a library of sequences of genes and gene clusters coding for the biosynthesis of weed-suppressive compounds.

PROJECT,VET - COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY-SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,1008962,2016-67015-24926,Modulation of Anestrus in Sheep by Hypothalamic Estrogen Receptors,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,460000.0,"Nett, TE.",ACTIVE,"Rationale: During a good proportion of the life of a female, their ovaries are not functioning. Non-functional ovaries leads to states when females can not reproduce because they are not releasing ova (eggs). These states are referred to as anestrus and occur prior to puberty, during times of the year whenthe ovaries are non-functional due to environmental conditions (seasonal anestrus), and during lactation (lactational or postpartum anestrus). These conditions limit the females lifetime productivity in livestock operations. In each case, the ovaries are non-functional because of hypersensitivity of the brain (hypothalamus) to baseline production of estrogen, an ovarian hormone that is produced at very low levels at all times. If the hypersensitivity of the brain to estrogen could be blocked, then it is likely that the ovaries would begin to function and the females woud again be able to reproduce. Overarching Hypothesis: Administration of an anti-estrogen (a compound that prevents endogenous estrogens from interacting with estrogen receptors in the brain) to females during anestrus will induce ovarian function (i.e. ovulation) and lead to an earlier pregnancy.Specific Objectives: 1) Determine if administration of anti-strogens to a mature female can extend the proportion of year when she is reproductively competent (i.e. extend the time when her ovaries are functional and producing eggs that can be fertilized), and 2) determine if andministration of anti-estrogens to young females will hasten the onset of puberty and initiate ovarian function.Expected Results:Administration of anti-estrogens to females with non-functional ovaries will induce ovarian function and release of eggs sooner than would occur normally. Therefore, this treatment should allow mature females to begin reproductive cycles sooner if they are in seasonal anestrus. Likewise, if the anti-estrogens are administered to immature females, it should induce ovarian function earlier than would occur normally (i.e. induce early puberty) . In either instance, this would permit the females to be bred earllier than normal, and increase their lifetime productivity (i.e. females will be able to produce more offspring over their lifetime).Anticipated Impact: The proportion of time that a female&#39;s ovaries do not function negatively impacts their abililty to produce offspring, basically the profit to the livestock producer. In the U.S., annualeconomic losses in the livestock industry associated with nonfunctional ovaries in females exceed $2 billion. It is anticipated that treating females with anti-estorgens at appropriate times will induce their ovaries to function sooner, and hence, allow them to become pregnant sooner each year and thereby increase their annual productivity. The initial studies are to be conducted in sheep with hopes of allowing mature animals to have two lamb crops per year rather than one. Likewise, about 20% of femalesheep do not deliver lambs during their first year of life because they do not reach puberty soon enough. The proposed treatments should induce early puberty and allow these lambs to be bred and deliver offspring at their first opportunity.Although the proposed studies are to be conducted in sheep, it is very likely that they can be translated to cattle since the underlying mechanisms controlling the reproductive processes in these speices are so similar. Therefore, the information to be obtained has the potential to increase reproductive efficiency in two different livestock species in the U.S. (and world-wide).","to determine if administration of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists (a) during anestrus can hasten the transition from anestrus to reproductive competence, and (b) near the end of the breeding season can prolong the duration of reproductive competence. to determine if administration of ER antagonists to pre-pubertal ewe lambs will hasten the onset of puberty.","estrogen, hypothalamus, sheep, Anestrus"

The incidence and impact of herbicide resistant weeds, especially those with multiple resistance, continueto create severe agronomic problems for agricultural producers. Studies of the resistance mechanisms will contribute tosuccessful resistance prevention and management strategies.","Objective 1) Refine our current panel of candidate genes linked to A. fatua NTSR.a) Mass spectrometry analysis of herbicide metabolism. Defining herbicide metabolite identities and rates of formation will provide critical data to inform our ongoing winnowing of candidate enzymes and genes of NTSR in A. fatua. We have chosen to conduct these assays using mass spectrometry (MS) instead of 14C-labelled herbicides, mostly to improve analytical sensitivity and reduce worker exposure to hazardous conditions. Our initial results with imazamethabenz-methyl (see page 5) support that decision. MS analysis will be used for exemplar herbicides chosen based on pro-herbicide character (fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, quizalofop-P-ethyl) or chemical family (pinoxaden, flucarbazone, difenzoquat, and triallate). Seedlings will be treated with herbicide at the appropriate growth stage, harvested at 0 (surfactant only, if used), 3, 6, 24, and 48 HAT, shoots frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground using a mortar and pestle. Plant tissue extraction procedures, internal standards, and chromatography methods will be optimized for each herbicide, with guidance from the QuEChERS (Pay&aacute; et al. 2007) analytical method.b) 2D-DIGE Proteomics. Based on our initial proteomic studies (Figure 1b), we will continue this analytical approach using 2D-DIGE. Two samples to be compared are labeled with different fluorescent CyDyes (Epstein et al. 2013), passively loaded onto one IEF gel strip (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) overnight, subjected to IEF electrophoresis for 44,000 volt-hours, and then transferred for SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. Gel scans (Typhoon Trio Imager; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) then detect differential levels and presence/absence of individual protein spots, which are isolated and subjected to automated amino acid sequencing (Shevchenko et al. 2007). Peptide sequences are verified by query against custom protein sequence files and identified using PeptideShaker software (Vaudel et al. 2015).Initial assays will compare protein constellations from untreated and herbicide-treated plants to isolate constitutive and induced, respectively, differentially-expressed proteins, as a complement to our RNA seq results. We will also make use of cysteine-labeling iodoacetylated cyanine dyes (Chan et al. 2012) to compare redox-dependent (Waszczak et al. 2015) constitutive and herbicide-induced protein changes between HS and HR plants. Potential changes in transcriptional regulatory networks due to protein phosphorylation state (Malhotra and Sowdhamini 2014; Nakashima et al. 2014) will be investigated using Pro-Q Diamond staining (Chen et al. 2012) of proteins extracted from untreated and herbicide-treated HS and HR plants. For the latter experiments, we recognize that the generally low abundance of such factors may make their identification using 2D-DIGE difficult.Objective 2) Validate the linkage of candidate genes with A. fatua NTSR.a) Determining the genetic control of HR. Genetic characterization of the A. fatua HR phenotype will create the framework on which all other studies will build. First, five seedlings from each of 80 F2:3 families segregating for HR (page 2) will be treated with 0, 0.5X or 1X of HR ED50 doses (Keith et al. 2015; Lehnhoff et al. 2013a) of exemplar herbicides from each mode of action family listed in the Introduction. Treatments are applied to seedlings with 1-cm long coleoptiles (triallate; Kern et al. 1996b) or at the 3-leaf stage (all others), and the resulting phenotypes assigned to HS, HR, or intermediate (if present) phenotypic categories as described (Karlowsky et al. 2006) for each herbicide. Segregation ratios will be tested using chi-squared analysis, and the results will provide estimates for number of alleles, degree of dominance, and potential linkage groups if any.b) Developing qPCR assays as HR molecular markers. qPCR primers will be designed (OligoAnalyzer 3.1; Dwight et al. 2011) for 30 candidate HR-related genes, which will be selected based on the enzyme and expression assays described above (pages 6-8), our RNA seq FASTA data, amino acid/DNA sequences derived from 2D-DIGE comparisons, and the literature. We will include proteins of herbicide metabolism (P450s, GSTs, CXEs, etc), redox modulation (GPOXs, DHARs, PRDXs, etc), ROS defense, transcriptional regulation (TFs and related proteins, phosphorylases, kinases, etc), and other factors involved in abiotic stress pathways. Total RNA will be isolated (Kern et al. 2005) over a time course from untreated and herbicide-treated HS and HR seedlings and subjected to qPCR assays following MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al. 2009). REST&reg; (Relative Expression Software Tool; Pfaffl et al. 2002) software is used to analyze data from three replicate plants and two PCR reactions for each sample. Expression ratios are tested for significance by a Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomization Test (&alpha; = 0.05), which makes no assumptions about the normality of data distribution and so is preferred to ANOVA-based tests for qPCR analysis (Pfaffl et al. 2002).","agriculture, avena fatua, herbicide resistance, resistance management, weed management"

Despite the presence of both satellite cells and MSC throughoutlife, each cell type is most abundant during the neonatal period providing a window of opportunity to maximally affect theircontribution towards developmental processes and lean tissue accretion.Neonatal nutrition can significantly impact lifetime growth performance. Our central hypothesis is that neonatal nutrition altersthe activity and differentiation potential of the stem cells that are responsible for muscle, fat, and bone growth. Ultimately,alterations to the stem cells impact the lifetime growth performance of pigs. Our overall goal is to improve the sustainability ofswine production by identifying the interactions between neonatal nutrition, genetics, and physiology that underpin growthperformance. Specifically, the objectives of this project are to:1. Determine the impact of neonatal nutrition on the activity and differentiation potential of satellite cells and MSC.2. Identify critical genes and miRNAs whose expression is affected in satellite cells and MSC by neonatal nutrition.3. Verify the importance of changes in the expression of identified miRNAs on satellite cell and MSC differentiationpotential.By completing this project we expect to:1. Elucidate the role of neonatal nutrition in impacting the developmental programming of muscle and fat growth.2. Provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential genetic regulatory networks responsible for alterations inthe differentiation potential of the tissue-specific stem cells responsible for muscle and fat growth.3. Identify differences in the genetic regulation of cellular activities among related tissue-specific stem cells toprovide insight into developmental programs.We anticipate that the change in knowledge created by achieving our objectives will lead to novel neonatal nutritionalinterventions that will improve the sustainability of swine production. We expect that these interventions will be able to reduceboth the cost and environmental impact of swine production by at least 15%.","Theoverall goalof this project is to improve the sustainability of swine production by identifying key interactions between nutrition, genetics and physiology that underpin growth performance. We plan togain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of meat production and adipose tissue deposition is essential to maximizing the lean growth of pigs in order to help achieve this goal. At the most basic level, the growth of muscle is dependent on the activity of satellite cells. Delay or absence of satellite cell proliferation and progression through the appropriate myogenic lineage impairs accumulation of postnatal muscle myonuclei and retards subsequent muscle fiber hypertrophy. While the postnatal growth of adipose tissue is a combination of both an increase in the number of adipocytes as well as increased lipid filling of the adipocytes, the increase in the number of adipose cells can be viewed as predisposing the pig towards fat deposition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) provide the pool from which new adipocytes can differentiate. Despite the presence of both satellite cells and MSC throughout life, each cell type is most abundant during the neonatal period providing a window of opportunity to maximally affect their contribution towards developmental processes and lean tissue accretion. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of the nutritional programming of satellite cells and MSC would provide the foundational knowledge needed to improve the lean growth of pigs in order to reduce production costs and the environmental impact of swine production.The fate of satellite cells and MSC are regulated via a complex series of steps requiring the timely expression and repression of specific genes. Recently the regulatory ability of very short segments of noncoding RNA, called microRNA (miRNA), to control gene expression has been implicated in these developmental processes. MicroRNA control target gene expression post-transcriptionally by either preventing translation and/or promoting mRNA degradation. While miRNA have a myriad of roles during development, they are known to be important modulators of both self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells, including satellite cells and MSC. Due to the complexity of the processes that would lead to altered differentiation potential of stem cells, it is likely that miRNA are involved. Although the importance of miRNA in the regulation of stem cell activity has been clearly demonstrated, the complexity of global miRNA and gene expression during myogenesis and adipogenesis has yet to be elucidated. Additionally, the impact of nutrition on these processes has not been examined. The central research hypothesis of this proposal is that nutrition alters cellular miRNA and mRNA which subsequently regulates satellite cell and MSC activity. Ultimately, the interrelationships between nutrition, miRNA, mRNA, and stem cells govern swine growth performance. Our working hypothesis is that the influence of neonatal nutrition on lifetime lean growth potential is governed by the miRNA and mRNA profile which regulates alterations in the activity and differentiation potential of both satellite cells and MSC. Neonatal nutritional programming of these cells may explain why increased weaning weights are associated with greater lean growth and growth performance. Yet, the environmental and biological signals responsible for satellite cell and MSC participation in postnatal growth remain ill defined. The paucity of information on the interaction between nutrition, satellite cell and MSC behavior and miRNA leaves us with several important questions that will be addressed at a fundamental level in the proposed objectives:Objective 1) Determine the impact of neonatal nutrition on the activity and differentiation potential of satellite cells and MSC.Objective 2)Identify critical genes and miRNAs whose expression is affected in satellite cells and MSC by neonatal nutrition.Objective 3) Verify the importance of changes in the expression of identified miRNAs on satellite cell and MSC differentiation potential. This proposal addresses the issue of improving growth performance by examining the cellular and molecular basis of muscle growth and adipose hyperplasia by utilizing a transdisciplinary approach combining nutrition, cell physiology, molecular genetics and biostatistics on the whole animal and cellular levels. Completion of our objectives will further our understanding of the impact of developmental programming on growth performance, and will provide the knowledge needed to develop new or improved management strategies to improve the efficiency of swine production. We anticipate that the completion of our objectives will:1. Elucidate the role of neonatal nutrition in impacting the developmental programming of muscle and fat growth.2. Provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential genetic regulatory networks responsible for alterations in the differentiation potential of the tissue-specific stem cells responsible for muscle and fat growth.3. Identify differences in the genetic regulation of cellular activities among related tissue-specific stem cells to provide insight into developmental programs.","developmental programming, neonatal nutrition, swine"

The current systems are inadequate to be used by nonprofessionals for real-time pathogen detection because they require long time (hours to days and weeks), expensive instruments, and extensive trainining of the personnel. The detection system we propose to develop in this study requires only a few minutes, inexpensive, and require very little training to be adapted and used by anyone involved in food industry. In this study, we propose to develop a system for simultaneous detection of several most common foodborne bacterial pathogens. However, as we improve our system in future studies, it can be expanded to include viruses and toxins to become a comprehensive detection system for any foodborne pathogens to improve public safety.","In order to prevent frequent outbreaks of foodborne pathogens, accurate pathogen monitoring throughout the food supply chain is essential. In this study, we will develop an accurate, cost effective, user-friendly, and, most importantly, rapid pathogen detection system for simultaneous identification of multiple foodborne bacterial pathogens. The proposed magnetoelastic particle (MEP) biosensors are composed of nanobiomolecular recognition elements (phage-displayed oligopeptide probes) and magnetostrictive particle platforms. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of our nanobiomolecular elements coated MEP biosensors for accurate and rapid detection of individual pathogens. In this study, we will develop a multiplex system capable of detecting the presence of several common foodborne bacterial pathogens including Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium perfringens, and Campylobacter jejuni in less than 20 minutes, including the sample preparation.

PROJECT,SAES - AUBURN UNIVERSITY,1009023,2016-67015-24916,Early Vaccination of Chickens Significantly Decreases Induction of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Specific Immunity,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,498988.0,"van Ginkel, FR, W.",ACTIVE,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an endemic disease and causes over $48 million a year ineconomic losses for the poultry industry due to decreased egg and meat production by infected chicken flocks. These IBV infections happen despite intensive vaccination of the chickens. Chickens get vaccinated for IBV at an early age, as young as 1 day after hatching. Vaccination of very young chickens, which have an immature immune systems, may lead to suboptimal immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that IBV vaccination during the first week after hatching induces suboptimal protection against IBV compared to chickens vaccinated later in life and early vaccination contributes to increased susceptibility to IBV infection even after booster vaccinations. To measure difference in the induced immune protection after vaccination at different ages, i.e., between 1 day old and 4 weeks of age, IBV vaccination and challenge studies will be performed. The immune response observed after vaccination in 1 day. 1, 2, 3 and 4 week old chickens will be analyzed for its ability to generate IBV-specific T cell responses and how booster vaccinations of these groups affect the memory immune response after such as the speed with which the immune response is induced after vaccination, the magnitude of the immune response and its ability to neutralize the IBV virus. We also measure the age-dependent protection in the respiratory tract following challenge with a virulent IBV strain by measuring virus load in trachea and tears in commercial chickens in order to see how our findings will translate to field conditions. Receptors in the chickens that recognize pathogens such as IBV, called Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) receptors, play an important role in not only initially recognizing IBV as an invading pathogen butalso initiate both the innate and adaptive immune response. Therefore, the expression of these receptors in 1 day to 4 weeks old chickens will be measured and it is anticipated that young chickens will express lower levels of these receptors. If our experiments will confirm our hypothesis, it will raise important questions pertaining to vaccines administered during the first week post-hatch and would urge the industry to reexamine current vaccination protocols.","We hypothesizethat IBV vaccination within the first week after hatch is detrimental for optimal induction ofmucosal and systemic immunity to IBV. Specifically, we anticipate that early vaccination restrictsthe immune response repertoire and magnitude of the immune response and may contribute to IBVimmune escape after both primary vaccination and boosting the IBV response. To address this issue we have defined the following objectives:1- Measure IBV-specific mucosal and systemic antibody and B cell responses to IBV andthe S1 part of the spike protein after boosting the vaccine responseat increasing age of the chicken.2- Measure T cell responses to IBV in systemic and mucosal lymphoid tissues in IBVimmunized chickens at increasing age of the chicken.3- Determine the dominant S1 protein-specific B and T cell epitopes recognized after IBVvaccination in chickens immunized on varying days post-hatch, i.e. at different stages ofimmune development.4- Measure mRNA expression of pathogen recognition receptors to assess the ability to generate an innate immune response after IBV vaccination in chicks of increasing age.5- Age-dependent protection against IBV challenge of vaccinated commercial layers.","mucosal immunity, vaccination, IBV, Age-dependent immunity, maturation of the immune system"

Fossil fuel price volatility over time makes it difficult for the plastics industry to pass on high costs to consumers. Continued worries about finite fossil fuel supplies is also a challenge for the industry. Most plastics derive useful properties from being mixed with non-plastic ""fillers"" that add value to the plastic. It is the continued development of new fillers that drives the use of plastics in new markets such asautomobile parts. Current agricultural practices utilize one part of the crop but not all of it. The unused part is usually disposed of or sold in a lower value market such as animal feed. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by proposing a new protein filler derived from an agricultural by-product called wheat gluten. The wheat gluten would have a new high value use and not be disposed, thus providing value to the farmer. The protein will be aggregated into a high performance nanostructured filler for plastics. The agriculturally-derived protein is biobased and would displace fossil fuel based material. This would allow plastics producers to worry less about finite fossil fuel supplies and continued price volatility. It would also increase the biobased content of the plastic and make it more environmentally-friendly. The filler is projected to compete performance and price-wise with current nanofillers used by the plastics industry.The protein will be mixed with fossil fuel derived rubber. The performance of the new protein/rubber nanocomposites will be assessed to determine the suitability of the material for commercial use. The new nanocomposites will be compared to current nanocomposites to see direct improvements to the current state of the art. This would result in new biobased materials for the plastics industry that can be used in the short term. Nanocomposites are a fast growing segment of the plastics market and this new technology could be very impactful in terms of delivering an economical and performance comparable product to the industry while creating a new value stream for the farmer.

Our overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the capacity of metagenomics to identify diverse prey in arthropod predators for field predation or food web studies. In this proposal, we will develop a comprehensive set of DNA reference databases and bioinformatics pipelines to analyze prey diversity in field-collected predators. To validate this novel methodology, we will stress its sensitivity and compare it to metabarcoding, a current method for gut content analysis. Specifically, we will characterize prey detection and detectability period in relation to prey and predator species and amount of prey consumed, and evaluate detection of indirect predation, closely related prey species, library insert size, and sample pooling.Arthropod predators are key biocontrol agents of agricultural pests, but their use has lagged because their predatory capacity has been difficult to measure and manage because predation events are infrequent and hard to see in the field. To estimate and improve their biological control service, it is fundamental to establish their trophic relations. By revealing more extensive prey, our PCR-free method will facilitate determining focal predators for use in conservative biocontrol initiatives and create improved understanding of some important ecological barriers limiting effective predation on target pests, which in turn, will lead to fresh ideas for managing generalist predators to enhance biocontrol.",Overall Goal.

PROJECT,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT RIV,1009136,2016-67011-25164,Analysis of the Interactions Between Parasitoids Released to Control the Invasive Giant Whitefly Aleurodicus dugesii Hemiptera:Aleyroididae,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,73711.0,"Schoeller, ER.",ACTIVE,"Biological control is manipulation of natural enemies by man to reduce or mitigate pest populations. A common tactic in biological control is to indroduce multiple species of natural enemies when attempting to control a pest. The rationale for this is that the combined efforts of multiple natural enemy species may achieve greater pest control than a single species alone. This tactic has had mixed success however, and one of the key contributing factors attributed to program failure is negative interactions between natural enemies. It is becoming apparent that taking natural enemy interactions into consideration when designing biological control programs is critical for ensuring their long-term success. To utilize such information into control-program design, we must first gain a better understanding of the form and function of natural enemy interactions.To investigate how the form and function of multiple natural enemy interactions we are examining interactions between three parasitic wasps released as part of a biological control program against giant whitefly (Aleurodicus dugesii), a serious agricultural and ornamental pest in the U.S. Experiments include: examining differences in parasitoid development, phenology studies examining parasitoid community spatial and temporal dynamics, examining the impact of super- and multiparasitism event on parasitoid coexistence, examining host selection and preference behaviors, and manipulation of parasitoid communities to examine the effects of parasitoid community composition on giant whitefly suppression.Data obtained from this study will increase our understanding of the dynamics of multiple natural enemy interactions and allow us to contribute to the debate surrounding the validity of multiple natural enemy use in biological control programs. These data will also allow us to enchance biological control of giant whitefly, a pest of many important ornimental and economic plants.","The primary goal of this study is to document the occurrence and dynamics of interactions between multiple biological control agents. Specifically, I aim to elucidate how environmental factors and species&#39; life histories mediate interactions between multiple naturalenemies and how these interactions affect the control of a shared host. This information can be used in tandem with background knowledge of a given system to make educated predictions on the outcomes of specific natural enemy release strategies. The secondary goal of this study is to apply the knowledge gained on the dynamics of the interactions between the multiple parasitoid species in this study system to enhance the biological control of A. dugesii.My specific objectives for this project are:1.To create phenological degree day models for the A. dugesii host whitefly and its three parasitoid wasps.2.To determine the host-stage preferences for all three parasitoid wasps.3.To determine the effects of super- and multi parasitism events on parasitoid oviposition and theoretical coexistence.4.To determine the impact of interspecific competitive interactions on all three parasitoid species&#39; efficacy as control agents of A. dugesii.5.To determine the spatial and temporal occurrence of species in this study system under different field conditions.","biological control, california, competition, Aleurodicus dugesii, Parasitoids"

PROJECT,ARCHBOLD EXPEDITIONS,1009150,2016-67019-24988,Manipulating fire and grazing to enhance the delivery of ecosystem services from subtropical humid grasslands,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499921.0,"Boughton, EL.",ACTIVE,"Grasslands (pastures, grazing lands, prairies, and rangelands) provide fundamental ecosystem services such as food provisioning, greenhouse gas (GHG) and water regulation, soil fertility and biodiversity. Grasslands occupy 26% of the world land surface, ~30% of which is located in the tropics and the subtropics, and they represent 70% of the world agricultural area. Grasslands produce essential forage for grazing animals with a substantial portion of their area managed for beef cattle production. Grasslands store &gt;10% of terrestrial net productivity and sustain up to 30% of the world&#39;s organic C in their soils. It has been suggested that grasslands remove ~ 20% of carbon (C) released annually from land-use change and deforestation. Therefore, grasslands provide essential regulating services important to global biogeochemical cycling and have a large carbon sequestration potential. However, grasslands and grazing animals are responsible for significant methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions; atmospherically important trace gases with global warming potentials 25 and 298 times that of CO2, respectively. Prescribed burns and wildfires are necessary to maintain the structure of pyrogenic grasslands worldwide, but fire alters ecosystem services affecting forage productivity, water and GHG fluxes. The balance between CO2 and trace gas (CH4 and N2O) emissions ultimately define the net GHG sink strength of grasslands and this balance is affected by grazing and fire management.This research will compare the delivery of ecosystem services from grasslands under two different management regimes: the ""business as usual"" long rotation grazing (LRG) and the ""alternative"" patch burn grazing (PBG) management. We will evaluate how alternative management affects the output of three ecosystem services, one provisioning (forage production and quality) and two regulating (greenhouse gas regulation and water use efficiency), compared with the ""business as usual"" LRG for subtropical humid grasslands. We predict that PBG grasslands will have greater output of ecosystem services, including higher forage quality (~+5% crude protein) than LRG grasslands, and ~3 times higher net greenhouse gas sink capacity and water use efficiency compared to LRG pastures. We will produce a variety of extension products, including factsheets and publications, and conduct public tours and field days to inform grassland managers of alternative management practices to minimize greenhouse gas fluxes, maximize net ecosystem uptake, and increase water use efficiency.","Grasslands in the U.S. are fire-driven grazing systems, but the potential to manipulate fire management to maintain or enhance provisioning services while also increasing other ecosystem services is only partially understood. For example, from Great Plains research we know that mimicking the fire-grazing interaction with patch-burn grazing (PBG) management benefits biodiversity, enhances soil nitrogen, and can reduce invasive plants (e.g. Fuhlendorf et al. 2006). However, little work has been done on how PBG affects ecosystem functions such as net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration (Sam Fuhlendorf, personal comm, Justin Derner, personal comm.) This study will fill major gaps in how PBG affects ecosystem processes such as productivity, GHG regulation, and water use efficiency (WUE). Fire is a major driver of ecosystem structure in subtropical humid grasslands, which are a mosaic of improved and semi-native pastures, prairies, savannas, and seasonal wetlands (e.g. in Florida, Stephenson 2011, Boughton et al. 2013). To our knowledge PBG has not been utilized east of the Mississippi (but see McGranaham et al. 2013); so this study will extend the understanding of PBG into subtropical grazing systems where grazing and fire are strong drivers.Our goal is to compare ""business-as-usual"" long-rotation grazing (LRG) with ""alternative"" patch-burn grazing (PBG) management to determine how manipulating patterns of grazing and fire affect the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services&minus; forage production and quality&minus;and regulating ecosystem services&minus;greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation and water use efficiency (WUE)&minus;from subtropical humid grasslands used for beef cattle production.We will use a 3-year randomized block design experiment to compare PBG and LRG at the Archbold USDA LTAR agro-ecosystem research site in Florida, a site representative of extensive subtropical humid grasslands. We will build on preliminary data, using an existing deployment of four eddy covariance flux towers measuring CO2, CH4, and ET, as well as canopy chamber measurements of trace GHG gases, and forage production plots.Our objectives areTest the predictions that PBG grasslands will have higher forage quality (~+5% crude protein) than LRG pastures, and ~three times higher net GHG sink capacity and WUE compared to LRG pastures.Incorporate results into a biogeochemical ecosystem model (DayCent), to predict how manipulating patterns of grazing and fire will affect long-term soil organic carbon, GHG regulation, and WUE from subtropical grasslands.Use a financial formula to evaluate economic impacts of grassland management regime, andConduct workshops and surveys on socio-economic considerations, using feedback to enhance extension products and PBG adoption by ranchers.","carbon sequestration, forage quality, water use, fire-grazing interaction, patch burn grazing"
PROJECT,SAES - NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY,1009198,2016-67019-25028,Circles of Live Buffer Strips in Center Pivot Irrigation for Multiple Ecosystem Services in the Southern Great Plains,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,145205.0,"Angadi, SA.",ACTIVE,"Irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer has converted the Southern Great Plains from a dust bowl to a highly productive agricultural region. Sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region is threatened by declining water resources, high wind and water erosion, loss of soil organic matter leading to low infiltration rate and water holding capacity, inability to conserve high intensity precipitation, higher evaporation losses due to abundant solar energy and strong winds, and lack of biodiversity. Water conservation and water productivity needs to be improved to sustain Ogallala aquifer for a longer period of time and reduce the frequency of dust storms. Novel technologies are urgently needed to alleviate above problems, while improving ecosystem services, quality of life and system resiliency under future climate.Declining Ogallala aquifer has resulted in many partial pivots. The project proposes an innovative idea of rearranging underutilized part of the pivot as circles of perennial grass barrier strips to reduce all above problems and reintroduce many more ecosystem services. Quarter of two pivots facing predominant wind direction will be used for the study. One will have perennial grass buffer strips every 60 ft. Grass buffer strips will be made up of mixture of tall prairie grasses and will be 30 ft wide. Wind and water dynamics in response to single or multiple circular buffer strips will be assessed with help of extensive instrumentation and data collection.Each components of the design like perennial grass, grass buffer strips, circular design and multiple circles add or improve benefits anticipated. Perennial grass in the system reduce erosion, sequester more carbon, use less energy, reduce inputs (water, fertilizer and other agrochemical inputs), reduce pollution, provide greater access to resources (sunlight, CO2, etc) over longer periods of time, improve system resiliency, and improve system resource use efficiency. While using the perennial grass as a buffer strip improves microclimate, water conservation, water use efficiency, soil protection, crop yield, while reducing water, inputs (fertilizer) and pollutants leaving the field. The most important benefit from converting buffer strips in to a circular design is its ability to moderate wind from any direction, because wind direction in most places changes quite a bit. Similarly, regardless of slope, inputs and pollutants leaving the field will be reduced. Using multiple rings of buffers improve most of the benefits. . Thus, circular buffer strips will develop a new system over the years that offers more ecosystem services and more sustainable under future climate than the current practices. Some of the benefits might increase with years.","The overall goal is to take advantage of existing partial pivot situation to develop multiple circles of perennial grass buffer strips based on aerodynamic principles to moderate wind speed from any direction, conserve most of the heavy intensity precipitation, improve infiltration and water holding capacity, sequester greenhouse gases and improve system efficiency by reducing resource losses. In a time, when majority of the ecosystem services assessed are being degraded or lost, the project aims to develop a technology that improves most of the ecosystem services. Specific objectives of the projects include: (1). Assess potential of circular buffer strips for improving in-crop and off-season microclimates and crop productivity (Regulating and Cultural Ecosystem Services) and (2). Understand wind and water dynamics in single and multiple circular buffer strips and assess their effects on crop productivity (Provisioning and Supporting Ecosystem Services).","Provisioning & Supporting Ecosystem Services, circular buffer strips, improving microclimates"

In 2007, the USFS implemented a new policy requiring the use of adaptive management for all grazing permits on national forest lands in Arizona and New Mexico. Unlike traditional management, adaptive management is intended to improve ecological, economic, and social outcomes by allowing for increased collaboration and flexibility to learn from and respond to change. Our primary objective is to determine if adaptive management actually improves outcomes. We will assess the impact of adaptive management on: (a) four ecosystem services--forage production, beef production, plant biodiversity, and soil health; (b) on ranch return on investment; and (c) on regulatory transaction costs for the USFS and producers. We assess impact on ecosystem services by fieldwork on USFS allotments and through re-analysis of existing USFS monitoring data. We partner with producers to assess the impacts of adaptive management decisions on ranch budgets and overall return on investment. Assessment of regulatory transaction costs is achieved through evaluation of compliance documents, interviews, and surveys. The results of our research will inform USFS decision-making about the use of adaptive management as a rangeland management tool in the southwestern US, and improve knowledge of where and when adaptive management improves ecological and socio-economic outcomes.

This projected 2050 world population would require a 70% increase in worldwide food production.More efficient and sustainable farming techniques are needed to meet such growing global food demands as population increase, available cropland reduces and climate change inflicts additional stress on crops.Developing soil-based biosensors that precisely tell the farmer when to fertilize their crops is desperately needed to increase crop efficiency while reducing negative environmental impacts. Pesticides are necessary to maintain and increase crop yields in order to meet the food demands of the burgeoning world population, however, pesticides propose a tremendous health and environmental burden on the environment and in particular watersheds. The now seemingly ubiquitous nature of pesticides in the environment, even at ""low"" concentrations, have far reaching and diverse negative effects from potential links to autism spectrum disorder to honey bee colony decline. Therefore, the need to regulate pesticide use and track pesticide run-off is paramount to environmental protection and in particular protection of surface and ground water where pesticides can be further transmitted through the food chain.Currently farmers do not have a reliable and cost-effective method to monitor pesticide concentrations in crop fields; do not have the tools necessary to prevent pesticide overuse and hence prevent pesticide water-contamination; and do not have a rapid, inexpensive method to monitor fertilizer levels in the soil and subsequently reduce/prevent fertilizer run-off into precious watersheds. Current methods for fertilizer concentration testing in soils include chromatographic laboratory methods that aretime consuming and expensive; require extensive sample preparation/cleanup; specialized personnel and instrumentation; and in some cases involve toxic solvents and chemicals that can be more harmful to the environment than the pesticides themselves. Thesechromatographic methodsare therefore not amenable to in field-testing nor for use in developing countries where resources are limited.This research will fulfill this technology gap.This project will produce a disposable test strip that can monitor pesticides levels on-site in soils in a manner of minutes with a portable electrochemical reader. The test strip will be patterned after the common glucose test strip that diabetics use to monitor their glucose levels and will be able to interface with an electrochemical reader much like the glucometer diabetics use. The test strip sensor developed in this project will be fabricated with inks that contain non-toxic nanoscale metal particles and biological molecules called enzymes. The combination of these nanoparticles and enzymes will be capable of selectively sensing pesticides in soils. Mathematical modeling and electrochemical experiments of these nanostructured test strip biosensors will be performed to determine the size, shape, and density of nanoparticle-enzyme compounds that are necessary for sensitive and selective pesticide detection in soil samples. The ultimate goal of this proposed project is to provide farmers and field help with easy-to-use, inexpensive, and rapid means to test the level of pesticides in the soil at the site of contamination. Such sensor technology will therefore be particularly well-suited for use in remote or resource limited countries where access to such technology is nonexistent. This technology is expected to decrease the pollution of farmlands and the environment due to water runoffs from overuse of pesticides. The progress of this work will be published in peer-reviewed journal articles, presented in national research conferences, and explained in workshops and classroom environments. ","The research goal of this project is to develop the nanomanufacturing techniques needed to create highly sensitive, multi-enzyme biosensors that can provide rapid, inexpensive, and in situ parallel screening of multiple pesticides in a single sample. Such a pesticide-screening test would be used to alert the user of potentially dangerous levels of pesticides in water, soil, or food products. More costly, but more accurate, chromatographic methods (i.e. gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) could then be reserved for identifying and quantifying pesticides in samples that did not pass the multi-enzyme biosensor-screening test.Objective 1.

However, these diets reduce rumen pH and result in a condition called sub-acute rumen acidosis. This condition reduces feed efficiency, reduces milk fat because of synthesis of bioactive trans fatty acids, and increase incidence of numerous diseases. This results in reduced animal welfare and farm profitability and sub-clinical rumen acidosis has been estimated to cost the US dairy industry between 500 million and 1 billion dollars per year.Rumination is a key process required by dairy cows for optimal digestive function and health. Rumination reduces digesta particle size, adds salivary buffers to stabilize rumen pH, and assists in mixing rumen contents. Reduced rumination has a number of negative consequences for the cow including decreased rumen pH and altered rumen fermentation resulting in poor performance and depressed milk fat. Recently, automated systems have been developed for observation of rumination on commercial dairy farms and are being used to manage reproduction and identify clinically sick animals. The rumination observation systems have the potential for determination of subacute rumen acidosis, but a lack of research data and benchmarks are limiting their usefulness.This research component of the project will collect milk samples from individual cows on 6 commercial dairies with rumination observation systems. Milk fatty acid profile will be used as an indication of rumen fermentation. Relationships between milk fatty acids and rumination behavior will be determined and benchmarks and prediction equations will be developed that can be used on farms. This information will be used to identify and reduce sub-acute rumen acidosis on farms. The extension component will deliver this information to field nutritionists and herd managers. This project meets a critical need to fully utilize a new technology that is being rapidly adopted on farms to reduce an issue that has major impacts on farm profitability and animal welfare.","The overarching goal of the project is to improve economic return and animal welfare of dairy farms by improving rumen health and increasing milk fat yield. This will be accomplished through an on-farm research project and integrated extension program that will increase the value of rumination observation systems rapidly being installed for reproduction and herd health.In an effort to meet the high energy and protein demands of lactation the modern dairy cow is fed a highly fermentable diet which increases the risk for sub-clinical rumen acidosis (a.k.a. SARA), milk fat depression, and incidence of numerous diseases. Sub-clinical rumen acidosis has been estimated to cost the US dairy industry between 500 million and 1 billion dollars per year and varies between farms, over time on the same farm, and within cows on each farm. Recent advances in on-farm technology provide the opportunity to monitor farm and individual cow response to diets with the goal of reducing altered rumen fermentation and associated issues. Development of benchmarks and methods to understand cow response to diet will allow more precise management at the herd and cow level.The specific objectives of the project are:1. Determine the relationship between rumination time and milk fat concentration and milk trans-isomer profile. Data will be collected from commercial farms with rumination observation systems. Milk fatty acid profile will be used as an indication of rumen fermentation. Repressions between rumination and milk fatty acids will be conducted and benchmarks for optimal rumination will be established.2. Development of extension programming reporting the variation in rumination and how to identify altered rumen fermentation.Development of benchmarks relating rumination with rumen fermentation will allow nutritionist and farm managers to better monitor diets and cows. Specifically, the real-time nature of rumination may detect high-risk diets before milk fat is decreased, identify cows at risk for altered fermentation, and allow development of advanced grouping strategies based on individual cow requirement for effective fiber.","bioactive fatty acids, Dairy herd, Milk fat depression, Rumination, Sub acute rumen acidosis"

This project will improve system efficiency and economic sustainability and is intended to encompass field machinery, transportation to storage, and storage, which is relevant to the Agricultural Systems and Technology program area. Field conditions and equipment performance, as a function of moisture, will be integrated with geospatial parameters to achieve site specific recommendations.The trend of ""big data"" in agriculture will continue to produce enormous amounts of data that are often underutilized. This project will apply data to develop and validate a model that will enable grain producers to make informed, information driven decisions relevant to harvest timing. Additionally, producers will be able to evaluate changes in infrastructure, utilization, and equipment ratios against potential losses due to timeliness.Data logged from the CAN-bus on field equipment, logistic data from transportation vehicles, and data logged from the grain dryer and storage facility will be used to define equipment performance and interactions. Field studies will be utilized to define losses from modern equipment and hybrids as a function of grain moisture over multiple crops in a three year period at a commercial farm.The proposed work differs from previous research in its scope, site specific recommendations, and the quantity of data that will be used to inform the model. The resulting model will use a geospatial platform to allow producers to incorporate the effects ofspecific field locations and geometry.","1. Modernize an expert capacity-based decision model that considers percent operating time, labor, energy consumption, and cost from harvest through delivery to the first storage location.2.

PROJECT,SAES - UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,1008660,2016-67014-24577,Abiotic Stress Response And Adaptive Phenology In Fruit Trees,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,425220.0,"Abbott, AL, GL.",ACTIVE,"Due to the broad climate adaptation of perennial trees, phenological traits (e.g. chilling requirement-CR, bloom date-BD) exhibit complex inheritance patterns. Conceptually, these are adaptive responses to abiotic stress. As production depends on traits like CR, breeders have developed varieties that are phenotypically/genotypically matched to particular geographic/temperature zones. These genotypes are ideal for study of gene networks governing these climate-critical traits. Using genetic approaches, genome-wide association analyses, functional and comparative genomics in fruit and forest trees, we identified a foundational network of genetic activity (phenylpropanoid pathway) linking winter cold stress response to control of the endodormancy-ecodormancy transition (EET) and seed stratification. Our goal is to examine during endodormancy the allelic effects of genes controlling the production of stress related metabolic intermediates that regulate seed stratification, thus linking these two cold temperature responses. Our objectives are:1. Using functional genomics approaches characterize genotypic effects on the phenylpropanoid gene network transcriptome during endodormancy and the EET.2. Examine the genotypic effects on the flux of specific phenylpropanoid intermediates and the timing of resumption of growth post-dormancy.3. Employ transgenic systems to characterize the phenotypes of expression pertubations of specific pathway genes potentially implicated as control points for the EET.These adaptive genes and gene networks will be targets for knowledge based breeding strategies of fruit and forest trees to sustain and improve these resources to meet the challenges of rapid environmental change.","As a likely consequence of broad adaptation by many perennial species to the different temperate zones, many important phenological traits (e.g. dormancy, chilling requirement, bloom date, vernalization), exhibit complex inheritance (QTL) patterns with multiple genes contributing to the final phenotype. Arguably, these kinds of phenological traits can be viewed as responses to abiotic stress.Due to the importance of appropriate abiotic stress responses to tree phenology, such as, dormancy, chilling requirement (CR), bloom date (BD), perennial plant breeders have traditionally focused on developing different varieties that cover the range of predictable variation for these important responses. In fruiting trees for example, having plant varieties that are phenotypically/genotypically matched for traits such as CR to a particular zone in the range of geographic temperature zones, enables varieties to be optimized for fruit production. This can be achieved by utilizing appropriate genetic materials to define chromosomal regions controlling the phenological trait (e.g. CR QTLs) then incorporating different levels of genomic analyses (transcriptomics, comparative genomics, resequencing /structural genomics) to identify the candidate genes in these intervals that are most likely associated with the trait. However, to simplify the tasks of collecting and interpreting the multiple levels of data required for identifying and characterizing the underlying genetic systems involved in abiotic or biotic stress responses of perennials trees, we need to utilize perennial tree species that have excellent genetic resources (i.e. phenotypic diversity) and compact genomes that are highly accessible for characterization.In this context, we are utilizing the peach (P. persica (L.) Batsch) and apricot (P. armeniaca) as foundational genome species for exploring the genetic landscape associated with the perennial life cycle, abiotic and biotic stress. These species are ideally suited for this because: 1) they are diploid species (n=8) with small genomes of ~230Mb and low proportion of repetitive elements in the genome (~ 20%-30%); 2) the peach genome (www. peachgenome.org) has been sequenced and assembled with a high quality similar to those of the Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium (Verde et al. 2013) and serves currently as the an excellent gene model and comparative genome system for other major deciduous forest species such as chestnut (J. Carlson and A. Abbott unpublished); 3) due to its relatively short generation time (2-3 years), stress responsive phenological traits both complex and simple have been map localized to high resolution ; 4) peach genome sequences are highly conserved with much less divergence among phenotypically diverse progenies and cultivars (high chill vs. low chill) which simplifies correlation of allelic diversity and candidate gene studies and finally 5) the apricot germplasm is ideally suited for high resolution genome wide sequenced based association studies (GWAS) studies (Apricot Whole Genome Project (ABRIWG)-ANR, INRA- Bordeaux, France).We have utilized these materials as a basis for comparatively identifying genes associated with winter dormancy in peach, apricot, chestnut, and oak (International ABRIWG Project, INRA-Bordeaux). Using traditional genetic approaches (QTL), GWAS (Genome Wide Association Analyses), functional genomics, resequencing and comparative genomics approaches, we have identified what we hypothesize as a foundational network of genetic activity that links winter cold stress response to control of the endodormancy-ecodormancy transition (EET).Overall hypothesis or goal: The control of plant growth and development over the EET has at its foundation a specific stress response gene network (the phenylpropanoid pathway) that, depending on environmental cues, directs the flux of metabolic intermediates some of which influence plant hormone actions for holding or releasing meristem growth. This pathway, perhaps not surprisingly, shares many components with the seed stratification pathway, thus providing logical links between these two cold temperature responses.Specific objectives: 1. Using functional genomics approaches characterize genotypic effects on the phenylpropanoid gene network transcriptome during endodormancy and the EET.2. Examine the genotypic effects on the concentration of specific phenylpropanoid intermediates and the timing of resumption of growth post-dormancy.3.

I have spent my graduate career focusing on methods to mitigate these losses with systems designed to reduce risk and increase yields while simultaneously protecting the environment. While we have made much progress, research is still needed in conjunction with extension efforts to educate producers to realize the full potential of drainage water management (DWM) systems. Considerable efforts have been made to show the economic and environmental benefits to producers. While we are moving forward with new DWM technologies, we still have producers that have not recognized or embraced the full potential of their existing systems. This work is intended to bridge the gap that has been created between the inherent benefits of using the practice and the lack of user management. This fellowship work will test a novel DWM design to further reduce producer management as a cost effective alternative to existing systems while simultaneously expanding DWM extension efforts in promoting the practice. This project was developed specifically to address novel technology in drainage water management (DWM), promote and educated producers, extension agents, soil and water conservationist, and NRCS personnel on water conservation, water quality, and crop yield benefits of DWM in North Carolina through the use of demonstration projects, factsheets, social media, field days, and technical training session.

In order to feed the population crop yields must increase. Over time, plant breeding has contributed roughly 50% of the increases in crop yields; therefore, plant breeding has an important role to play in feeding the growing population. A key concern that accompanies population increase is the gradually warming environment and increased frequency of extreme climate events. Reduced yields of many important food crops including wheat are expected to occur in response to warming. Thus, the challenge to breeders is even greater.In this proposal, we will carry out studies in which breeding populations are artifically warmed by passive and active methods. We will measure response to all agronomic traits including yield, but will focus especially on the impact of warming on disease resistance genes. Breeders need to know how the disease resistance that they use in crosses will fare in response to warming.We will communicate the results of these studies to other breeders through scientific publications, posters and talks at scientific meetings. We will also communicate our results to stakeholders (e.g. farmers) whose enterprises will be affected by climate change and climate variability, so they can understand the importance of climate change adaptation traits when choosing a crop variety.","The over-archinggoal of this proposal provide guidance to breeders on how to incorporate the target of adaptation to climate change into a breeding program.

These initiatives can stimulate market opportunities related to environmental benefits that agriculture can influence, produce, or sell. Such opportunities can enhance agricultural viability and can sustain rural communities consistent with environmental stewardship. In many cases, non-agricultural industries are subject to environmental compliance standards and water quality cap-and-trade markets generate opportunities for agricultural producers to participate voluntarily in providing offsets. Agriculture can produce pollution offsets through adoption of best management practices (BMPs) that reduce nutrients entering rivers and water bodies and thereby generate a credit that can be sold to offset pollution from regulated industrial point-sources.This proposal offers to advance the valuation of ecosystem services (sometimes called ancillary or co-benefits) produced in connection with water quality credits arising from agricultural BMPs. We offer to explore how conservation-buyers could connect these values to credit production and revenues for agricultural producers. We will make the connection in part by (i) providing an approach (knowledge) that could support on-the-ground decisions to encourage alternative subsets of co-benefits through investment choices regarding BMPs for water quality and by (ii) demonstrating how a public agent, perhaps acting through an independent (non-profit) partner, could use valuation methods to inject the social value of co-benefits into existing water quality trading exchanges. We will conduct experiments that not only measure the value of co-benefits for a subset of the public, but also leverage a new water quality trading platform to enhance our understanding of the conceptual and empirical foundations for non-market valuation based on stated-preference (SP) methods, particularly choice experiments (CEs), or surveys designed to measure environmental values of citizens.This proposal will advance the valuation of ecosystem services in connection with water quality credits arising from agricultural BMPs.

Past SRWC research provides valuable insights into the performance of certain species in selected environments. However, studies comparing an array of species side-by-side across a wide range of conditions are lacking. Process-based models, which account for environmental influences on tree growth, can be used to compare species performance across a range of environmental conditions in a quantitative, spatially-explicit manner.

While calves are traditionally sold at weaning or after back-grounding, retained ownership allows producers to garner additional profits through improving beef quality. There is a huge price margin for beef graded as Prime, and this grade is mainly based on the degree of marbling (intramuscular fat) for young cattle. Marbling is affected by both genetics and nutrition. In terms of genetics, Wagyu cattle have very high marbling and Angus have relatively high marbling. For nutritional management, recent data point to the importance of maternal nutrition during late pregnancy on the marbling of offspring cattle. We hypothesize that: through maternal nutritional supplementation and genetic improvement, cow-calf operators can produce high quality beef, which will generate sizeable profits for these farmers. We plan to first evaluate the improvement of body condition score of calves, which will impact the selling price of calves if producers choose to sell. Production efficiency of offspring cattle and marbling will be further evaluated. A systematic assessment of the net profits for adopting this new quality-based management system will be conducted. Finally, for the small farmers and ranchers to benefit from our project, a strong extension program will be implemented to disseminate this knowledge to these producers. We expect that nutritional and genetic management of cows and calves are unique opportunities for cow-calf producers to substantially improve the profitability of farm operation, which will generate sizeable profits for these farmers. ","The major goalis to test the hypothesis thatthroughmaternal nutritional supplementation and genetic improvement, cow-calf operators can produce high quality beef, which will generate sizeable profits and improve the sustainability of cow-calf operations.Specific goals are:Test the effects of maternal nutritional management and genetic improvement on the muscle thickness and value of calves. We plan to inseminate Angus cows with either Angus or Wagyu semen (improve marbling through genetics). In addition, cows will be subjected to dietary treatments to achieve different nutritional levels based on NRC maintenance nutrient requirements during mid to late pregnancy, in order to test the impact of maternal nutrition on the growth performance and beef quality of offspring cattle. In this aim, we will focus on analyzing the value of weaning calves based on their body condition, muscle thickness and uniformity in frame sizes, as well as their anticipated high marbling carcasses at slaughter. This knowledge will provide producers with information about profits to be generated if producers sell calves at weaning without retaining ownership. The working hypothesis is that maternal supplementation will improve the value of calves, thereby increasing their selling price if producers opt to sell at this stage.Identify the impacts of maternal nutritional and genetic management on the beef quality of offspring. The working hypothesis is that nutritional and genetic management will increase carcass yield and considerably elevate marbling, thus increasing the occurrence of Prime-grade carcasses in offspring. (Currently, only 2% of the carcasses produced in the US qualify for Prime grade.)Examine economic returns to farms due to the improvement of beef quality. Farmers are expected to increase revenue by selling their calves at a higher price or marketing high quality beef at a premium price through retaining ownership. However, they also need to pay additional costs associated with nutritional supplementation and genetic improvement. A systemic economic assessment of the net profits for farmers is needed.Disseminate knowledge to cow-calf producers through extension.

We will (1) use DNA and molecular biology to quickly identify downy mildew disease of cucumber, melon, pumpkin, squash, lettuce, spinach and basil, and determine if it is resistant to fungicides, (2) track downy mildew disease of cucumber, melon, pumpkin, squash and basil yearly on a map at a website that growers and home gardeners can access, (3) breed basil, spinach and cucumber plants that are resistant to downy mildew, (4) evaluate whether our research solutions will be economical, (5) inform growers and the public of our research, and (5) involve college students in our research so they can be better prepared for jobs once they graduate. Growers will limit the losses from downy mildew diseases of cucumber, melon, pumpkin, squash, lettuce, spinach and basil by making informed decisions based on tested solutions developed through science. We will educate diverse and underrepresented college students in agricultural sciences. The solutions from our research will apply to other crops affected by other types of downy mildews because the pathogens that cause these diseases are similar. Therefore, this project will also benefit a wide group of growers and consumers interested in onion, sunflower, hop, broccoli, and cabbage.","The goal of our Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) is to improve/develop novel Agricultural Production Systems that detect and track downy mildew (DM) pathogens and contain them through sustainable and effective mitigation.

Clinically, PRRS causes reproductive failure (abortions and stillbirths) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease in piglets. Studies conducted by the National Pork Board estimated that the annual losses caused by PRRSV to the U.S. swine industry were $560 million in 2005 and $640 million in 2011. Reducing the economic impact of PRRSV is the top priority to the swine industry. Although PRRS vaccines are commercially available, the efficacy of the current PRRS vaccines is far from satisfactory. The main limitation of the current PRRS vaccines is that they do not provide adequate protection against different PRRS virus strains circulating in the field. Effort to develop an effective PRRS vaccine is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of vaccine-induced protection, the highly variable nature of the viral genome, and the viral ability to subvert the host immune system. The overall objective of this research proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which a PRRS vaccine provides protection against PRRS virus infection. We have recently developed a fully synthetic PRRS virus strain that is able to provide unprecedented levels of protection. In the current project, we will compare the immune responses between pigs infected with our synthetic PRRS virus strain and those infected with a naturally occurring PRRS virus strain to identify the mechanism of protection. The knowledge resulting from this study will be valuable for the rational design of an effective PRRS vaccine with improved levels of efficacy. The availability of such a vaccine will be of cardinal importance for the successful control of PRRS virus and thereby, enhancing the sustainability of the U.S swine industry.",The goal of this proposal is to understand themechanisms of protection against PRRSV infection.

PROJECT,SAES - MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1008898,2016-67015-24891,Flavobacterial diversity and its effect on disease in aquaculture,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,360428.0,"Faisal, MO.",ACTIVE,"Fish currently comprise one of the most important animal protein sources for the ever-expanding human population, much of which is supplied through aquaculture. Unfortunately, flavobacterial fish diseases, caused by bacteria within the Family Flavobacteriaceae, are a significant threat to the productivity and health of farmed fish. Among flavobacterial fish diseases, bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) is particularly devastating, causing massive losses in salmon and trout farming operations around the world. In the United States, BCWD is a significant impediment to salmonid aquaculture, where losses sustained in farmed rainbow trout stocks (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are particularly substantial (i.e., up to 70% of an affected stock may die due to the disease). Although there is a general consensus among scientists that BCWD is caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the continued failures to control this disease have raised numerous concerns. One dilemma that recently surfaced is the disputed cause of BCWD and whether it is caused by all F. psychrophilum strains or distinctly virulent ones, and whether F. psychrophilum causes BCWD alone, or in combination with previously undescribed non-F. psychrophilum flavobacteria. This uncertainty may be behind the inconsistencies observed in BCWD control and the discrepancies in diseases diagnosis. Towards this end, we formulated a central hypothesis that BCWD is caused by genetically distinct strains of F. psychrophilum, certain non-F. psychrophilum flavobacteria, and/or combinations of F. psychrophilum and non-F. psychrophilum flavobacteria. To test this hypothesis, multiple objectives were conceived that, upon completion, will: 1) examine the genetic diversity of F. psychrophilum isolates from all over the US as it relates to their ability to cause disease and resist antibiotic treatments; 2) clarify the role that non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria play in BCWD, both alone and in combination with F. psychrophilum, using experimental challenge; and 3) determine if a newly developed vaccine against F. psychrophilum will protect against multiple F. psychrophilum variants, as well as non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria. The data generated from this study will be conveyed to stakeholders within the US aquaculture industry through peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals, in presentations at scientific conferences, and through collaborative outreach and extension efforts. As a result, aquaculture professionals within the US will be better equipped to prevent and control flavobacterial disease outbreaks, thereby potentially reducing operational costs and improving farm profitability. This study directly aligns with the Animal Health and Production AFRI Priority Area (2008 Farm Bill) and with Animal Health and Disease RFA (Program Area Priority Code - A1221).","The Central Hypothesis of the proposed study is that Bacterial coldwater disease is caused by genotypically/phenotypically distinct strains of F. psychrophilum, certain non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria, and/or a combination of F. psychrophilum and non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria. The diversity of flavobacteria may impair accurate diagnoses and complicate the efficacious control of disease outbreaks. In order to test this hypothesis, multiple long term goals and supporting objectives were conceived and are described below:Long-term goal(s) and supporting objectives of the proposed project:The goals of this project revolve around: A) addressing important knowledge gaps that directly impede our ability to control BCWD and minimize the resultant losses; and B) highlighting the flavobacterial species and/or strains that are most commonly responsible for BCWD outbreaks in the USA, as well as identifying those that are most virulent to farmed rainbow trout, thereby facilitating the development of novel and targeted control strategies that will improve the health of farmed rainbow trout.Little progress towards understanding the population structure of F. psychrophilum as it relates to pathogenicity has been made in the US despite the continuous losses that US salmonid aquaculture operations sustain as a result of BCWD. Similarly, the relationship of the F. psychrophilum population structure to antibiotic susceptibility are unknown, which may have unknown consequences on current efforts to prevent and control BCWD. This lack of knowledge greatly impedes our understanding of this pathogen&#39;s ecology. Thus, Goal 1 is to fill these gaps in knowledge through the use cutting-edge molecular techniques that will elucidate some of the important facets of this bacterium&#39;s epidemiology within the US aquaculture industry.Emerging reports of novel flavobacteria, particularly Flavobacterium and Chryseobacterium spp., associated with systemic disease outbreaks in farmed fish have raised concerns about their contribution to BCWD and other similar diseases. Of equal concern is the fact that some of these newly described non-F. psychrophilum flavobacteria were recovered from fish exhibiting disease signs that are traditionally characteristic of F. psychrophilum infections or from fish suffering from polymicrobial infections also comprised of F. psychrophilum. Indeed, the PD and Co-PDs have recovered multiple non-F. psychrophilum flavobacterial isolates originating from farmed fish that were either co-infected with F. psychrophilum or had gross signs of disease consistent with those caused by F. psychrophilum. Not only does the involvement of novel or uncharacterized flavobacteria complicate BCWD diagnosis, but this also challenges our ability to effectively prevent, manage, and treat flavobacterial fish diseases. Thus, Goal 2 is to delineate and characterize the potential involvement of other etiological agents in BCWD, both alone and in combination with F. psychrophilum (i.e., polymicrobial flavobacterial infections), using molecular and experimental challenge studies.A novel measure to control BCWD caused by F. psychrophilum in the form of an avirulent live vaccine has recently shown promise. However, its ability to protect against other fish-pathogenic flavobacteria involved in polymicrobial infections with F. psychrophilum and/or flavobacteria easily confused with F. psychrophilum, requires in depth investigation. Likewise, the ability of the vaccine to protect against F. psychrophilum strains belonging to a variety of Clonal Complexes and Sequence Types remains unclear. Thus, Goal 3 is to clarify the ability of this newly developed vaccine to confer protection against multiple F. psychrophilum variants, but also other fish-pathogenic flavobacteria.To address the three aforementioned goals if this project, the following objectives will be completed within the proposed three year study:Objective 1- Elucidate the genotypic/phenotypic diversity of F. psychrophilum strains recovered from US salmonid aquaculture facilities at the population and molecular levels and experimentally determine how such diversity relates to in vivo virulence and antimicrobial resistance.Objective 2- Identify non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria/chryseobacteria recovered from US farmed salmonids exhibiting BCWD signs and elucidate their ability, alone and in combination with F. psychrophilum, to reproduce BCWD.Objective 3- Determine if vaccination against F. psychrophilum confers protection against representative F. psychrophilum Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) variants and non- F. psychrophilum flavobacteria/chryseobacteria.",Flavobacterium; Bacterial coldwater disease; Aquaculture; MLST; Vaccine; Antibiotic resistance

This project will comparatively analyze the effect of two serovars of Salmonella infection on chicken regulatory T cells (Tregs), the role of these Tregs on suppressing other components of immune cells, and the molecular kinomic and metabolomics pathways through which a persistent Salmonella infection alters Treg functions.Tregs specialize in immune suppression, and several bacterial pathogens, especially mucosal bacteria, have evolved to escape host immune responses by activating Tregs. We previously identified CD4+CD25+ cells as Tregs in chickens. Our preliminary study identified that a Salmonella infection induced dysregulation in Treg percentage, Treg suppressive properties, and kinomic profiles at the local site of Salmonella colonization, namely the cecal tonsils.We hypothesize that a Salmonella infection causes metabolic reprogramming and kinomic changes in host Tregs to induce host immune suppression and Salmonella pathogen persistence. Through the specific aims, we will determine the effects of S. enterica serovarEnteritidis and serovar Heidelberg infections on Treg properties and quantify interactions between Tregs and CD4+, CD8+, macrophages, and B cells and determine the kinomic and metabolic pathways through which Salmonella reprograms and regulate Treg properties.We expect to establish the time course and kinetics of Treg suppressive effects and kinomic dysregulation and the absolute magnitude for these changes at the local site of bacterial replication during Salmonella infections.

PROJECT,SAES – TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,1008944,2016-67015-24923,A Host-Pathogen Approach to GWAS for Enhanced Resistance to Bacterial Mastitis in Dairy Cattle,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,450000.0,"Seabury, CH.",ACTIVE,"The primary goal of this project is to identify naturally occurring genetic variation that is either statistically predictive and/or causal for improved resistance to clinical mastitis in commercial U.S. dairy cows. Clinical mastitis is characterized by abnormalities in the milk or udder of dairy cows, which negatively impacts dairy production, thereby triggering economic losses, and diminished food security. Herein, we focus on clinical mastitis that is caused by Escherichia coli, with E. coli often being the most commonly isolated bacterial organism observed among U.S. dairy cows that experience single or recurring episodes of clinical mastitis. Relevant economic losses in the U.S. have been reported to exceed 700 pounds of saleable milk for a single cow experiencing clinical mastitis, which would include direct production losses, or the withholding of drug contaminated milk (i.e., therapeutic treatment) from the market. To reduce national dependence on therapeutic agents (i.e., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs) while also enhancing dairy production, we take a novel approach which seeks to define natural genetic variation among U.S. production dairy cows and their E. coli clinical mastitis isolates that either jointly or independently enhance the risk of disease. At present, genetic data are already heavily utilized for accurately predicting many dairy production traits in the U.S., and form the basis for modern selective breeding programs (i.e., genomic selection). Information regarding naturally occurring genetic variants among U.S. dairy cows and E. coli bacterial isolates that enhance risk for clinical mastitis will be incorporated into existing U.S. dairy prediction and selective breeding programs. Selective breeding of more resistant U.S. dairy cows is ultimately the most sustainable approach to reducing disease incidence and associated production losses, as these cows will possess superior production efficiency, require less handling, experience improved animal welfare, require decreased use of therapeutic agents (i.e., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs) and are ultimately the most profitable.","The primary research objective of this project is to identify bovine genetic variation associated with enhanced risk of E. coli CM in U.S. Holstein dairy cattle, and to use this information to foster the deployment of SNP-based selection tools that identify dairy cattle with reduced susceptibility. To increase the precision and likelihood of detecting associations with susceptibility, we will focus on the lifetime clinical mastitis distribution for a single bacterial pathogen (E. coli), thus creating a very precise animal disease phenotype. Moreover, genome sequencing data generated from the diagnostic isolates that define each E. coli CM case will also be used in a mixed-model approach to estimate the joint effects and/or interactions related to both host and pathogen genomic variation with respect to risk for recurrent E. coli CM in dairy cattle. Completion of these objectives will positively augment modern on-farm prevention and control measures, and therefore, is expected to allow for a significant reduction in recurrent E. coli CM among dairy cattle. To achieve our overarching primary research objective, we will employ the following specific objectives:Use &gt; 9,000 precisely documented Holstein dairy cows from commercial NY dairies to define the extremes (i.e. tails) of the lifetime E. coli clinical mastitis distribution andselect cows from each extreme (i.e. multiple E. coli CM cases and controls with zero lifetime CM). To increase our sample size, we will also use these data to match single E. coli CM case cows and zero lifetime CM controls by lactation, age, and herd.Holstein cows with one or more (i.e. recurrent) episodes of diagnostically confirmed E. coli CM will be selected as ""cases"", with enrollment priority given to cows with &ge; 2 confirmed E. coli CM episodes. A CM severity score will also be assigned to case cows (see approach). Precisely monitored cows matched by lactation, age, and herd that display no lifetime evidence of CM will be selected as ""controls."" The ratio of controls to cases will be &gt; 1:1 (n = 500 controls and 300 cases), which is determined by the prevalence of single and repeat E. coli CM cases prior to and across the award period.E. coligenomes representing the diagnostic isolates recovered from CM case cows will be sequenced to &ge; 40X average coverage using standard paired-end libraries applied to an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to facilitate E. coli strain classification, and to elucidate genome-wide information regarding strain-specific variation.All cows will be genotyped using the Illumina GGP-HD 135K assay and imputed to 778K density. Bovine 778K genotypes and E. coli variation will be bioinformatically joined for use in a novel genome-wide association analysis (GBLUP; EMMAX; Bayesian Models) that accounts for E. coli strain and/or polymorphism information with respect to risk for E. coli CM episodes and clinical severity (see approach) while also correcting for any pedigree-based stratification among the cows.Bovine and/or E. coli markers which are statistically predictive for risk of E. coli CM in Holstein dairy cows will be transferred to the stakeholders in a format that is cost-effective, efficient, and readily incorporated within other ongoing efforts to employ genomic selection in beef and dairy cattle (BRD-CAP Project; Bovine Feed Efficiency Project; Heifer Fertility Project; Bovine Functional Assay Project; Dairy Fertility Project).","dairy cattle, e. coli, mastitis, Animal Breeding and Genetics, Genome-Wide Association"

However, rapid growth rate in broilers is known to be associated with pulmonary hypertension syndrome (ascites). Ascites causes substantial economic losses due to mortality and condemnation in poultry. Most economical feasible treatments used to reverse ascites are in direct conflict with normal management practices (i.e. feed restriction). Thus, there is a need to develop new methods to prevent ascites. In the absence of such methods, the developments of effective interventions strategies to address this health problem will likely remain problematic. The long-term goal in our research program is to develop and implement effective interventions that will improve the health of poultry, especially those that are susceptible to ascites. The overall objective of this particular application, which is the next step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to determine the contribution of ghrelin in the development of ascites in broilers.

All developmental stages of the tick from larvae to adult feed on a single host animal, preferentially cattle. The tick creates a wound to blood feed and damages the animal hides, decreasing their value. Most importantly, during blood-feeding the tick can acquire or transmit microorganisms that cause the cattle diseases babesiosis and anaplasmosis that are highly lethal to cattle. These disease-causing microorganisms can be transferred to tick eggs inside the female tick, therefore, tick larvae born from the infected eggs can transmit the microorganism to new cattle hosts, continuing the cycle of disease transmission. There are no vaccines available in the US against these diseases. Cattle producers use chemical pesticides called acaricides to control tick populations, but many of these populations have developed acaricide resistance, surviving pesticide applications. Acaricide resistance is widespread in Mexico, and despite strict inspection and treatment of cattle at the US-Mexico border, incoming tick populations are a constant threat to the US cattle industry. Live cattle and wild animals, such as white tail deer, can carry live ticks across our southern US border. There is an urgent need to develop new acaricides for tick control and this project addresses this need to improve animal production and health.This research aims to find new chemicals (natural or synthetic) to kill these ticks in novel, selective manners. To do this, we will identify tick proteins belonging to a protein superfamily known as G protein-coupled receptors. Identification of these proteins is valuable for two main reasons: 1) they are thought to be critical for tick survival and, 2) their function can be disrupted by application of a foreign natural or synthetic molecule. We will use a molecular genetics technique called ""gene silencing"" to knock out or eliminate the ability of these receptors to perform their normal function in the tick. It is expected that the lost function of these receptor proteins will interfere with the survival or reproduction of the ticks providing new knowledge on tick physiology. We will select the receptors that are most critical for tick survival and thus are good candidates for disruption. We will also screen chemicals to identify those that disrupt the function of the selected receptors to reduce survival and/or reproduction of the ticks. Chemicals that succeed in disrupting tick receptor protein function will form the basis for development of new acaricides urgently needed for tick control.","Significance of the overall Goal: The ""cattle fever tick"" or ""Southern cattle tick"" is the most economically damaging tick for cattle worldwide.

The goal is to find selective targets for interventions, those that are either not present in mammals or those for which high selectivity or specificity can be achieved to eliminate non-target effects.Our working hypothesis is that G protein-coupled receptors are suitable targets for the development of novel acaricides, vaccines, and/or insecticides. GPCRs are the most successful target of the pharmaceutical industry because they are ""drugable targets"" and are currently unexploited targets for arthropod control. A novel approach for targeting water balance in ticks is investigated. For selectivity, we chose receptors not present in mammals or those for trace amines in mammals.Specific ObjectivesPharmacological profiling and peptidomimetics design: the pharmacological profile of G protein-coupled receptors for biogenic amines (tyramine/octopamine) and small neuropeptides that putatively function in tick water balance will be determined with endogenous and synthetic ligands. This involves the design of more stable and potent peptide analogs based on these structure-activity relationship studies. Screen small chemical libraries to identify lead agonist or antagonist structures.Physiological target validation of receptors in Obj. 1: Receptors for tyramine/octopamine, kinin and periviscerokinin will be silenced in adult ticks through RNA interference.Chemical target validation and chemical screens: Active synthetic molecules in Obj. 1 and others (terpenoid library, guanidinium library, etc.) will be used for validation in vivo to determine their utility as chemical leads. This will be done by bioassays with ticks in the laboratory.","disease prevention, Cattle fever tick, Cell, G protein-coupled receptors, RNAi phenotype, Tick control"

However, there has been a gradual decline in reproductive efficiency of dairy cows, resulting in substantial economic loss to farmers. Most failed pregnancies are due to embryonic death, which could be due to inadequate function of the corpus luteum (CL). The CL is a structure on the ovary that secretes progesterone, which is essential for survival of the embryo. The long term goal of this research program is to increase understanding of the function of the bovine corpus luteum (CL). Immune cells are present in the CL and serve as local regulators of the function of the CL, but very little is known about the types of communication that occur between the progesterone-producing cells and the immune cells. The global hypothesis to be addressed is that the progesterone-producing cells in the CL communicate with the resident immune cells via secretion of microscopic (extracellular) vesicles, which transfer proteins and nucleic acids directly to the immune cells, thus programming the functional capabilities of the resident immune cells. To test this hypothesis, cells from the CL will be cultured and the secreted extracellular vesicles will be isolated from the culture medium. The vesicles will be used to treat immune cells, and the effect of the vesicles on immune cell functions, including gene and protein expression, will be determined. Further, we will determine if regulation of the immune cells by the vesicles is altered during the early stages of pregnancy. Finally, the protein and nucleic acid content of the vesicles will be defined in an effort to identify the molecules that regulate immune cell function. It is expected that these molecules will differ in cells from pregnant compared to nonpregnant cows. These will be the first reports of how the hormone-producing cells within the CL communicate with immune cells to regulate the overall function of the tissue. Understanding how immune cells that populate the CL are regulated could ultimately lead to new methods to enhance reproductive efficiency of dairy cows and lower the costs of food production.","The long term goal of this research is to increase our understanding of the function of the bovine corpus luteum (CL) to enhance reproductive efficiency of dairy cattle. The decline in reproductive efficiency of dairy cows is well-documented (Lucy, 2001) and results in substantial economic loss within the agricultural industry each year. Because fertilization rates are generally high (90-95%), the loss in reproductive performance is primarily due to inadequate function of the corpus luteum, early embryo death, or failure of the embryo to prevent luteolysis and develop a placenta. Inskeep and Dailey (2005) have estimated that 73% of reproductive loss in dairy cattle is due to embryonic loss, with 57% occurring before the onset of placentation. Progesterone production by the corpus luteum is essential for the establishment of pregnancy in all mammals. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate luteal development and survival will lead to enhanced reproductive efficiency and lower the costs of food production.A focus of our research has been to understand the regulatory interactions that exist between parenchymal (steroidogenic and endothelial) cells and immune cells that result in normal luteal function. Compelling evidence exists that immune cells and the cytokines they produce regulate luteal function and facilitate luteolysis. However, immune cells, and all components necessary to activate those cells, are present within luteal tissue long before the onset of luteolysis. New ideas about the roles of resident immune cells as regulators of normal tissue homeostasis are emerging, but have been largely overlooked in studies of ovarian biology. We have demonstrated that luteal cells are potent activators of T cells in vitro. Recently, we discovered that the type of communication between luteal steroidogenic cells and immune cells changes with functional status of the CL. Luteal cells from mature, fully functional CL can activate T cells (TC) regardless of cell-cell contact, implying that signaling involves a secreted substance(s). In contrast, luteal cells obtained from regressing CL require cell-cell contact to fully activate TC. Given our results and other recent advances in knowledge of lymphocyte biology and cell-cell communication, the global hypothesis to be addressed by the proposed research is that steroidogenic cells from functional CL exert influences on resident immune cells via secretion of extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles), which transfer proteins and nucleotides directly to immune cells (IC), thus programming the functional capabilities of resident IC.Objectives:Determine how extracellular vesicles released from steroidogenic luteal cells alter phenotype and function of immune cells.Evaluate effects of estrous cycle stage and pregnancy status on extracellular vesicle-induced changes in immune cells.Determine the effects of estrous cycle stage and pregnancy status on protein and nucleic acid content of luteal cell-derived extracellular vesicles.Identify proteins and/or nucleic acids responsible for the luteal cell-induced changes in immune cells.","bovine, corpus luteum, cow, fertility, Extracellular Vesicles, Exosomes, T lymphocytes"

One of the main factors that impact birth weight, is the function of the placenta. The placenta is important to the growth of the fetus as it delivers all of the nutrients (including things such as glucose, amino acids, and oxygen) that are required for proper development. One big predictor in the placenta&#39;s ability to deliver these nutrients is uterine and umbilical blood flow. Our laboratory has demonstrated that nutrient restriction reduces umbilical blood flow and the lambs are decreased in weight near the end of pregnancy compared to adequately fed control ewes. We have also noticed that if we investigate the arteries that supply the placenta from the restricted ewes, they have even greater potential to dilate (thus deliver more flow) if they are provided with a substance that stimulate blood vessels to dilate. This leads us to think that the placenta is not making enough of factors that cause dilation. Recently in human and rodent placentas, they have noticed that a special cell type in the placenta, called trophoblastic giant cells (TGCs) are making factors that cause dilation. Our hypothesis is that during nutrient restriction, TGCs may be decreased in number, or their ability to produce factors that can cause blood vessels to dilate and grow will be reduced compared to adequately fed ewes. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim I. To determine how duration and timing of nutrient restriction impacts umbilical blood flow during pregnancy; Specific Aim II. To determine if maternal diet and stage of pregnancy impact the number of TGCs as well as to discover factors that aid in vessel function. We believe that we will discover that restricted ewes that are refed will have increased numbers of TGCs and they will produce more factors that promote blood flow. The anticipated impact is that we will use this information to fill critical knowledge gaps in placental function and pregnancy.","Trophoblastic giant cells (TGCs) in rat and human placentas appear to contribute to the overall function of the placenta and potentially nutrient transport. We have demonstrated that maternal responses to varying levels of nutrition alter uterine and umbilical blood flows, as well as placental arteriole vascular responsiveness. While it appears that overall capillary density is not impacted by maternal diet, differences in placental function must occur to elicit these other responses. The overall hypothesis is that TGCs (also called binucleate cells) from ovine placentas contribute to overall placental function, namely in allowing the placenta to be more efficient in nutrient delivery. We have previously demonstrated that nutrient restriction reduced umbilical blood flow in ewes. We are unaware of any published data on what effect realimentation will have on umbilical blood flow in the ewe, but we have previously reported that cotyledonary endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression is increased upon realimentation. The specific hypothesis is that realimentation will cause umbilical blood flow to return to levels similar to ewes that never experienced nutrient restriction, and the ability to achieve normal levels of umbilical blood flow is driven by angiogenic/vasoactive factors being produced by TGCs. Our goal is to quantify TGCs and vasoactive factors that they produce during an adquate and restricted fed state. There are 2 specific aims for this Seed Grant:Specific Aim I. To determine how duration and timing of nutrient restriction impacts umbilical blood flow during pregnancySpecific Aim II.

PROJECT,WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY,1009012,2016-67013-24930,Integrating Modeling and Field Experiments to Guide Weed Management in Rangeland Systems,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,430882.0,"Houseman, GR, RU.",ACTIVE," A primary threat to ranching systems in the Midwest is invasion by Sericea Lespedeza (Lespedeza Cuneata) which strongly reduces native forage and leads to high economic loss if left unchecked. The plant is a perennial with a long-lived seed bank and spreads by wind, animals, and human activities. Consequently, this weed can quickly become a long-term problem typically leading to increasing control costs with time. Once established, the only tool to control Sericea is herbicide application which can add substantially to operational costs because of the expenses of locating and treating Serica patches scattered over large landscapes. The problem for ranchers is to determine the most cost-effective way to control this weedy invader in rangelands. Because of the large seedbank that develops, effective short-term control many not be the most effective approach over many years. For this reason, we have developed a preliminary bioeconomic model to examine both short and long-term consequences of different treatment approaches. This analysis suggested that that a three-year application strategy is the most cost-effective approach. However that model is relies on the limited data that is currently available, which is often not from grazed systems. Further, there is no verification that these intial predictions are reliable because no field tests have been conducted. In this project, we use experimental plots on several ranches in southeast Kansas to test some of the basic predictions of the preliminary model and further refine the model to account for differences in soil fertility, landscape heterogeneity and invader spread. Additionally, we will use experiments to determine the effectiveness of different search strategies and develop an additional component of the model to quantify whether investment in searching for new plants or herbiciding known patches yields greater long-term control of the invader. Importantly, the models will include the economic costs associated with the weed control approaches utilized and impacts on potential revenue. These results will be integrated into a web-based tool that will allow ranchers and weed control professionals to input information from their particular ranch and obtain the most cost-effective solution for Sericea control on their land. This project will also serve as a test case to illustrate how field-based optimization models can be efficiently developed for weed management problems in other systems."," Within the ""Controlling Weedy and Invasive Plants"" Priority Area, our project explicitly addresses the current issue: ""Other ecological or evolutionary studies that would inform weed management strategies, including links between agronomic practices and weed problems"" as stated in the RFA. Current recommendations for controlling Sericea come from a piecemeal set of studies representing disparate systems and have virtually no evidence-based analysis of the economic best-practices. Our project will provide a new level understanding built on the insight and analysis from an integrated team of ranchers, weed ecologists, and modelers using state-of-the-art approaches in a realistic context. To do this, we focus on two major goals:Goal A: Utilize empirical data and models to understand how the biological characteristics may provide new ways to control Sericea in grazed systems.Objectives:1. QuantifySericea population growth, spread, and response to herbicide on several ranches in the Great Plains.2. Quantify how soil fertility influences herbicide effectiveness.3. Quantify Sericea detection and treatment probabilities.Goal B: Validate and refine a preliminary bioeconomic model using field data that accounts for critical species information and economic realities for weed management of Sericea in grazing systems.Objectives:1. Test the predictions of the preliminary model on these ranches in response to different rotational herbicide strategies.2. Refine the bio-economic model by addressing the inevitable shortcomings of the preliminary model to more accurately quantify how the investment in weed control influences potential profits over the long-term.3. Develop an integrated search and control model based on empirical data to determine how investment in search effort (likelihood of detection) or control practices (herbicide application) contributes to long-term control and profitability of grazing lands.4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization model strategy to combat ongoing or emerging weed management problems. Using Sericea as a case study, we will examine how to effectively develop a team of ranchers, weed ecologists and modelers to efficiently and effectively generate economic and ecological forecasts that will guide land management decisions.5. Develop a web-based decision-tree tool that landowners can use to forecast how investment in control strategies and methodologies are expected to impact long-term control and profitability.","detection, invasion, rangeland, spatio-temporal, weed management, Bioeconomic model, Sericea"

Althouigh diagnostic laboratories have consistently isolated Clostridium bacteria from the lesions of dermatitis, the exact pathogenesis is not fully understood. There are genetic differences among clostridium organisms isolated. Some are more pathogenic than others and some are more potential toxin producers than others. There is very little information as to how exactly these bacteria gain access and play a role in producing dermatitis lesions in turkeys in light of their (CP / CS) presence in most of the turkey growing environments. Although their ability to cause dermatitis through their exotoxins is known, there are no reported studies to explain in what circumstances CP / CS are able to produce specific CD lesions in turkeys. Oral challenge with Clostridial cultures alone in our experimental studies was not sufficient enough to reproduce CD lesions in healthy turkey poults. and nobody has examined the natural route of exposure of these organisms in causing dermatitis. This research project has following two Specific Objectives: Objective 1. To study whether the exposure to Clostridia from farm environment with and without cutaneousinjury results in Clostridial dermatitis in turkeys. Objective 2. To determine whether immunosuppression caused by either, Dexamethasone (Dex) or viral induced immunosuppression by prior exposure to Hemorrhagic enteritis (HE) virus influences the development of CD.","We hypothesize that CD in turkeys results from clostridial organisms entering via compromised cutaneous tissue. In our earlier studies, experimental subcutaneous inoculations with Clostridia consistently produced CD lesions in turkey poults as against oral route. Our previous work with oral exposure of Clostridia did not result in CD lesions. We have 3 specific aims under this Objective. Under Specific Aim 1: To investigate the cutaneous route of exposure of Clostridial organisms. Two approaches will be evaluated. 1. Effect of dermal injury; 2. Feather follicle entry. Under specific aim 2, we will investigate whether Hard wood shavings and/ or Sunflower hulls used by some turkey producers as litter and quantity of Clostridial presence in these particular type of litter influences the development of CD in turkeys.Under Specific Aim 3: we willconduct field studies where we will examine whether any correlation exist between Clostridial load in litter and CD outbreaks between hybrid and Nicholas breed of turkeys. In objective 2. we will use a chemical Dexamethasone to induce immunosuppression and also Hemorrhagic enteritis (HE) virus which is known to produce both immune-suppression and gut damage prior to the administration of Clostridia. We hypothesize that immunosuppression will effectively facilitate the development of Clostridial dermatitis upon subsequent exposure to Clostridia. The birds immunosuppressed with either Dexamethasone or Hemorrhagic enteritis (HE) virus will be exposed to CP / CS organisms to examine the development of CD. This study focusses on the influence of immunosuppression on the development of CD.","pathogenesis, turkey, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridial dermatitis, Clostridium septicum"

However, reducing the use of antibiotics in production animals will require replacement products that positively impact growth and performance. A promising area of research is the use of probiotics to mimic the effects of antibiotics in animals, but our understanding of how antibiotics work compared with how probiotics work in the animal is limited.In this project, we will study promising probiotic candidates in commercial turkeys. We will compare probiotics with antibiotics for their ability to enhance animal growth through shifts in the bacterial flora of the animal, and modulation of the animal&#39;s immune system development. The outcome of this project will be improved understanding of the mechanisms by which antibiotics and probiotics work, and how these products can be appropriately used to improve animal health.","The goal of this work is to understand the mechanisms by which bacterial succession occurs in the avian gastrointestinal tract in coordination with the host, and to identify effective ways to modulate the totality of avian intestinal bacteria (the microbiome) to prevent disease and improve bird performance. We have observed that there is a highly predictable pattern of bacterial succession in the turkey ileum as a bird ages, and this correlates with increased average daily weight gain. With this knowledge, we seek to change the paradigm by which alternatives to antibiotics are developed, using systematic approaches with application towards any animal species. To do so, the following specific objectives will be accomplished:Objective 1. Identify host-microbiome relationships that occur during turkey development and gastrointestinal microbiome modulation. The succession of the turkey intestinal microbiome occurs in a highly predictable pattern, and the timing of this succession is shifted earlier in higher-performing flocks. However, it is unclear if shifts in microbiome succession related to enhanced performance are direct drivers of these observations, or instead are indirect players in this process. The avian microbiome can be modulated through antibiotics and various direct-fed microbials or probiotics; although we do not understand if the means by which these products act on the host are mechanistically similar. In this Objective, we will take a comprehensive and systems approach aimed at identifying the relationships between 1) natural turkey intestinal microbiome succession and host development, and 2) intestinal microbiome modulations and host status. Overall, this Objective will identify the key correlations occurring between the intestinal microbiome, gut development, and specific host factors enabling enhanced turkey health and development.Objective 2. Determine if bacterial host specificity or genetic background impacts the capacity to enhance growth and development. The key to effectively and reproducibly modulating the turkey intestinal microbiome is improving our understanding of the subsets of the microbiome capable of modulation in a desirable fashion. We believe that the ileum is the single most critical intestinal location related to early brood period development, and that the microbiome within this location plays a critical role in such development. We have recently identified several key bacterial species that confer beneficial effects on the turkey host in terms of microbiome modulation and enhanced bird performance. Here we will test the hypothesis that 1) genetic adaptations in turkey-specific bacterial lineages enhance their capacity to influence growth and development, and 2) appropriate combinations of these strains will yield a synergistic effect. This Objective will improve understanding of how the turkey intestinal microbiome can be reproducibly modulated to improve health and performance, and as such will yield diagnostic targets and bacterial candidates of direct use to the poultry industries.",key words: avian; microbiome; intestinal; health; turkey; bacteria; probiotic; antibiotic

The diseases that this grant proposes to investigate (tuberculosis, anaplasmosis, Johne&#39;s disease, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)) cause billions of dollars in losses to U.S. agricultural producers. In addition, tuberculosis, anaplasmosis, and Johne&#39;s disease are zoonotic diseases, in which animals can serve as reservoirs and vectors of disease for humans. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, infect one-third of the world&#39;s human population, and are responsible for 1.5 million human deaths worldwide per year. While Mycobacterium bovis infection of livestock and humans has been nearly eliminated in the U.S. by decades of culling infected animals and pasteurizing milk, importation of infected livestock and dairy products from Mexico and infected deer reservoirs have resulted in cattle and human infection and deaths in the U.S. The rise in consumer demand for ""raw"" unpasteurized milk also increases the danger of a Mycobacterium bovis outbreak. History has shown that the best way to treat disease is to prevent it through vaccination, with the long-term goal of driving it into extinction. Smallpox and rinderpest virus are two examples of pathogens that are now extinct because of vaccination. This is especially true in agriculture, in which diseases may not be fatal to all animals, but severely impact producers because animals fail to reach market weight in a timely fashion, incur veterinary medical bills, and fail to deliver viable young. Chronically infected animals can infect the whole herd or flock. Thus, it is critical to develop effective vaccines to prevent animal pathogens from gaining a foothold. Most classic vaccines rely on activating a white blood cell called a ""B cell"", which produce antibody proteins that bind specifically to the pathogen and lead to its elimination. These B cells produce only one type of antibody per cell and display a memory response in that they act faster the second time they encounter the pathogen and are thus able to prevent infection. However, many pathogens are able to evade these antibody proteins through mutation because the antibodies are so specific. For these pathogens, it has proven beneficial to design vaccines that recruit a second type of immune cell capable of a memory response, the T cell. There are two types of T cells: alpha beta T cells and gamma delta T cells. Much more is known about alpha beta than gamma delta T cells, but we do know that gamma delta T cell respond much more quickly than B cells or alpha beta T cells, that they can recognize pathogen molecules that the pathogens can&#39;t mutate because they are integral to pathogen survival, and that, unlike B cells, they make the potent protective chemical interferon-gamma. We have shown that the efficacy of a vaccine to the bacteria Leptospira in cattle is correlated with the development of an early-acting gamma delta T cell memory response, and that a gamma delta T cell protein called WC1-3, which binds directly to Leptospira, is involved. WC1-3 is only one of 13 WC1 genes in cattle that have been conserved over millions of years of evolution. Because the normal tendency of nucleotide sequences in genes that fulfill no function is to accumulate mutations that render them non-functional ""pseudogenes"", it is likely that each WC1 gene has been preserved through recognition of a different class of pathogens. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that gamma delta T cells respond to Mycobacterium, and that two other WC1 proteins bind to Mycobacterium. In this grant proposal, we propose to obtain the nucleotide sequence of previously unknown WC1 genes in sheep, cattle, and pigs and to investigate the mechanism of these proteins interaction with, and activation by, pathogens. Identification of the molecules bound by WC1 will allow to create more effective designer vaccines that recruit multiple arms of the immune response, including the early and potent gamma delta T cell response. ","Major long-term goal: To define the molecular recognition structures and mechanisms involved in &gamma;&delta; T cell interactions with pathogens in food animal species, so that activation of these cells may be targeted in next generation vaccines. &gamma;&delta; T cells are unusual T cells, in that they respond much faster than conventional T cells and respond more broadly to pathogen molecules than antibody-producing B cells, which predicts that pathogens will be less likely to evade the &gamma;&delta; T cell response by mutation. Designing vaccines enriched in the pathogen molecules that specifically activate &gamma;&delta; T cells will recruit these cells to the immune response and potentially result in more effective, more broadly reactive vaccines. In addition, the characterization of variation in this host:pathogen interaction is of potentially high impact for selective breeding or genetic modification for disease resistance in food animals. We have focused on the WC1 gene family in cattle, which is expressed on &gamma;&delta; T cell, and which we have shown contributes to the immune response to pathogens. This study extends this work to WC1 genes and pathogens with significant impact in pig, sheep and goats.Objective 1: Molecular characterization of the WC1 genes and proteins in pigs, sheep, and goats.Objective 2: Evaluate the ability of WC1 proteins to bind pathogens relevant to pigs, sheep and goats.Objective 3: Characterization of the potential role of WC1 extracellular and intracellular domain splice variants in pathogen binding and signaling for &gamma;&delta; T cell activation.","cattle, goat, sheep, swine, Co-receptor, Gamma delta T cell, Pattern recognition receptor, WC1"

An improved variety of intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium L.; IWG) called ""Kernza"" could serve as an economically feasible alternative grain crop for mitigating GHG emissions because 1) it can provide economically viable, food quality grain yields with fewer GHG emissions that annuals and 2) provide vegetative biomass for bioenergy production. My objectives are: 1) measure C storage in roots and soil along with harvestable C in vegetative and seed biomass in IWG cropping systems. Measurements will compare IWG C dynamics across locations, stand ages, and N fertilizer rates. 2) Use results from objective 1 to parameterize the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to simulate GHG mitigation potential and economic returns of IWG. 3) Develop a spatially explicit model that integrates EPIC output with existing soil and climate databases to estimate where annual wheat rotation yields are low and can be replaced by IWG without economic loss based on IWG grain and biomass yields in Minnesota.

PROJECT,SAES - KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,1009132,2016-67030-24956,Precision Crop Protection:  Soil Management Zones for Optimizing Weed Control Efficacy,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,100000.0,"Dille, JO, AD.",ACTIVE,"Herbicides are the major pesticide input in agriculture in terms of volume and market share. Preemergence soil-applied herbicides continue to be widely used in many crops. Atrazine was applied to 55% of the total corn area, while acetochlor and s-metolachlor were applied to 38 and 27% of the total corn area in the USA in 2014, respectively (NASS 2015). In Kansas, total land area of 4.05 million corn acres, 2.85 million grain sorghum acres, and 4 million soybean acres were planted in 2014 (NASS 2015). Significant acres planted to these crops, together with increasingly more acres treated with PRE herbicides, highlights the efficacious and economic need to optimize the application of these soil-applied products. Soil application of herbicides for preplant or preemergence weed control is not a new technology but has slipped from producers&#39; minds with the advent of herbicide-tolerant corn hybrids and soybean cultivars. Herbicide-tolerant traits in corn, soybean, cotton, sunflower, and soon in grain sorghum, encourage producers to use more post-emergent (POST) herbicides, often glyphosate or other broad spectrum products. With the shift to these herbicide choices, however, an increased occurrence of weeds resistant to these same or related herbicides has occurred, resulting in poor or complete lack of weed control (Godar and Stahlman 2015; Godar et al. 2015). As a result, the use of soil-applied herbicides as a tool for integrated weed management in corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production will need to increase. Many herbicides that are applied to soil for weed control do present their own concerns from an environmental standpoint, such as carryover issues to subsequent crops in a rotation (Van Acker 2005), loss of efficacy with rapid degradation rates (Shaner et al. 2007), or leaching and/or runoff to groundwater and surface waters (Van Acker 2005). The activity and fate of soil-applied herbicides are affected by multiple soil factors, including soil organic matter (SOM), pH, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and texture (Blackshaw et al. 1994; Kerr et al. 2004; Nordmeyer 2015), which affect the adsorption of the herbicide to soil. Adsorption of herbicides to soil determines the bioavailability of the chemical in soil solution to weeds for control and to soil microbes for degradation.Spatially-dense maps of soil properties would allow design of effective prescription maps for soil-applied herbicide applications. The next step is to actually apply these herbicides using the prescription map in the field. Equipment to apply VRA herbicides according to prescription maps is currently available (e.g., Gerhards et al. 2001; Vogel 2004). There is great potential to reduce total herbicide load applied, and to place the right amount of herbicide in the right place in the field for greatest efficacy.Precision application technology has been available to VRA soil-applied herbicides for more than 15 years, but the algorithms necessary for optimizing the use of these tools still need to be developed and validated for use in farmers&#39; fields. There is no published research that has evaluated the use of VRA soil-applied herbicides in the field. Herbicide labels describe how recommended rates can be varied based on soil texture, SOM, and pH, which are soil properties that can vary dramatically within a given field, not just from one field to the next. Theoretically, it has been demonstrated that VRA herbicide applications should be effective (Novak et al. 1997; Shaner et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2001).The overall goal of this project is to develop procedures for determining effective soil management zones for variable rate application (VRA) of preemergence (PRE) soil-applied herbicides for corn, grain sorghum, and soybean production fields across Kansas and surrounding states based on apparent soil electrical conductivity (soil ECa) and related data. A Veris MSP3 system will be used across 6 different fields of ~5 ha to document soil ECa, organic matter, pH, topography and other data that can be used to define soil management zones. Each zone is expected to require a different herbicide rate for efficacious weed control. To determine the appropriateness of these soil management zones we will set up comparisons using strip trials of VRA and uniform soil-applied herbicide applications in each of these fields in 2016. The herbicide application effectiveness will be evaluated by sampling soil in each strip before and after application to determine herbicide binding and residue, and by using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with optical sensors, together with on-the-ground evaluation, to determine weed control efficacy. Grain yields will be collected across each strip using a combine equipped with a yield monitor, if available, or an area within each strip and soil management zone will be hand-harvested to determine yield. These studies will be repeated over two years in different fields, thus refining the precision crop protection algorithm based on first year results.The goal of VRA soil-applied herbicides is to optimize weed control efficacy (right rate in right location) while maximizing profit per acre, to minimize potential losses (due to leaching or rapid degradation), and to limit spread of herbicide-resistant weed populations in fields.","Our major goal is to develop and evaluate algorithms for the variable rate application (VRA) of preemergence (PRE) soil-applied herbicides for corn, grain sorghum, and soyean proeuction fields using soil management zones based on apparent soil electrival conductivity (soil ECa) and related data.The specific objectives will be to1) evaluate methodology to develop appropriate soil management zones based on ECa, organic matter (OM), pH, topography, and other soil property data collected using Veris MSP3 soil mapping system;2) assess appropriateness of these soil management zones by using strip trials in whole fields (~5 ha) to compare effectiveness of VRA to uniform soil-applied herbicide applications according to soil management zones and weed species present;3) assess VRA application effectiveness by a) sampling soil in each strip before and after herbicide application to determine herbicide binding and residue, and b) using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) with optical sensors, together with on-the-ground evluation, to determine weed control efficacy.","spatial, preemergence herbicides, small unmanned aerial systems, soil electrical condictivity"

We know little about how effectively soilnitrification transforms the concentrated ammoniacal component of digester liquids applied tofodder crops across a range of soil temperature and water regimes. Two fundamentally differenttypes of soil microbes (Archaea and Bacteria) are responsible for soil nitrification and theirrelative contributions are affected by soil temperature and ammonium availability. Both types ofnitrifiers produce N2O as a side product of ammonia oxidation, but the soil and climatic factorsaffecting their respective N2O contributions in the field are unknown. Our proposal consists of aseries of objectives that include laboratory and field experiments that will examine the influenceof soil temperature, water content, and level of digester N on the relative contributions ofArchaea and Bacteria to soil nitrification and N2O derived from nitrification. The secondobjective examines the influence of digester N on Archaeal and Bacterial nitrification under fieldconditions, and the effect of different phenological stages of fodder crop growth on N fate. Thethird objective evaluates how soil temperature affects the imbalance between nitrite production andconsumption during nitrification, its recovery, and impact on N2O production. The research fits theANRCVC program and Climate and Microbial Processes program area. It is focused upon the role ofmicrobial nitrifier communities on GHG emissions from digester N applied to croplands acrossseasons where soil temperature and water availability range considerably.","The overarching goal of this proposal is to extend the knowledge we have gained about the factors influencing the contributions of ammonia oxidizing Archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to soil nitrification. Specifically, we wish to gain new knowledge about how these contributions might influence the behavior and fate of manure digester N applied to two major fodder crops, annual ryegrass and silage corn. The two plant species are grown back-to-back on large dairy farms in the PNW, resulting in digester N being applied to crops over a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. To date, our own published and unpublished data show that the relative AOA and AOB contributions to soil nitrification are strongly influenced by season, presence of crop plant, level of available NH4+, and by soil temperature. No information exists on the impact of manure digester N levels, and seasonal climatic and plant growth stage factors on the efficacy of coupling of the two halves of soil nitrification. Our specific objectives are:Objective 1. To determine how soil temperature and water content influence the overall nitrification response and the relative contributions of AOA and AOB in soil supplied with different amounts of digester ammoniacal N.

While growers almost certainly have specific, non-random reasons for their farm configuration, aside from anecdotal reports these reasons are unclear. This knowledge gap makes it challenging to design farmscapes that maximize ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, biocontrol, pest deterrence) without interfering with agronomic realities of daily farm life. Our goal is to use recent insight on phylogenetic diversity in plant communities to optimize spatial combinations of crops on farms to improve insect management. This research will be accomplished via a combination of web-based online vegetation mapping surveys (Obj 1), common garden experiments (Obj 2), and on-farm manipulations in direct collaboration with growers (Obj 3). The work flow is specifically organized to first understand existing grower behaviors, followed by research to develop both theoretical and practical solutions. Given the recent expansion of diversified farms to meet growing demand for local produce, this research is closely aligned with the needs of an emerging commodity in U.S. agriculture","Objective #1: Determine how and why diversified growers spatially configure crops across their farm, and correlate these patterns with pest outbreaks. Our working hypothesis is that relatedness of nearest-neighbor plants (i.e., those growing directly adjacent to the focal crop) will exert the strongest influence on pest colonization and damage with progressively weaker effects at greater distances. Nevertheless, we also predict an emergent community-level outcome whereby phylogenetically depauperate farms suffer from more intense pest outbreaks compared with those cultivating a phylodiverse plant assemblage.Objective #2: Experimentally assess the consequences of plant phylogenetic relatedness for insect pests, predators, parasitoids, pollinators, and crop yield. Our working hypothesis is that phylodiversity will directly reduce pest colonization and increase crop yield. The indirect effects on pests and crops, however, hinge on corresponding responses by natural enemies (predators + parasitoids) and pollinators, respectively.Objective #3: Test the practicality of adopting a phylogenetic approach by working with commercial growers to transform crop spatial designs on working farms. We predict that optimal phylogenetic pairings are not always agronomically desirable or economically viable. Thus, we will test the value of a compromise strategy that accounts for both phylogenetics and grower preferences based on whole-farm function.","biodiversity, ecosystem services, phylogenetics, polyculture, spatial mapping, diversified farming"

It is urgent to develop novel control methods against the varroa mite. Disruption of the mite-specific neuropeptidergic system by using peptidomimetic compounds specifically appeals in this case. In searching for a specific toxic target of varroa mites, we investigated two closely related neuropeptidergic systems, tachykinin-related peptide (TRP) and natalisin (NTL), and their respective receptors. Honey bees lack both NTL and the NTL receptor in their genome sequences, providing the rationale for developing mite-specific peptidomimetics. In cell-based receptor assays, serendipitously, we have discovered that a group of peptide is highly specific to VdTRP receptor, but not to AmTRP receptor, providing a scaffold for designing bee-safe acaricidal peptidomimetics. We propose to 1) design and synthesize mite-specific peptidomimetics for enhanced bioavailability and biostability, 2) test the pharmacological activities of the peptidomimetics on the three receptors of varroa mite and honey bee, and 3) conduct bioassays to determine the toxicological activities the peptidomimetics on varroa mite. Integration of the efforts of three PD and co-PD, who are experts in each objective, is planed in the proposal. The proposed activity will be a novel expedited translational research for development of environmentally benign target-specific toxins. The imminent problem in conservation of pollinator and in apiculture is addressed in this proposal, which fits in ""Strategies to mitigate abiotic and biotic factors threatening managed bees (program area priority A1111, plant associated insect)"".","Finding the toxic agent selective against varroa mite without negative effect on honey bee would start from understanding the difference between closely related two species, the host and the parasite.We have been looking for differences in the neuropeptidergic systems in between honey bee and varroa mite, which can be the excellent target of acaricial peptidomimetics. Based on their genome sequences, we found that honey bee lacks a neuropeptide natalisin peptides and the receptor, which were recently described as a neuropeptide and the receptor involved in reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster and in Tribolium castaneum, while the varroa mite retained the natalisin and the receptor. The absence of natalisin system in the honey bee led the hypothesis that the nalalisin neuropeptidergic system can serve as a honey bee-safe acaricidal target in apiculture. Disruption of the neuropeptidergic system by using peptidomimetics specifically appeals in this case. Small synthetic peptides including unnatural amino acids can be designed for improving the specificity of the compounds for the target peptide receptor. Furthermore, a major limitation in practical use of the peptidomimetics in the field, the high costs for large scale synthesis, can be overcome by use of peptidomimetics in a small scale only in bee hives.As a preliminary study, we have tested the recombinant natalisin receptor of the varroa mite (VdNTLR) on the endogenous natalisin peptides of varroa mite and small number of peptidomimetics. In addition, we tested the receptors for tachykinin, the closely related neuropeptide to the natalisin, in varroa mite (VdTKR) and in honey bee (AmTKR). So far, we find moderate levels of selectivity of varroa mite natalisin on the VdNTLR with some cross activity to AmTKR, implying designing selective peptidomimetics on VdNTLR is possible.We propose to provide the proof of concept whether peptidomimetics targeting the varroa mite-specific natalisin system can be developed as a honey bee-safe acaricide. Specific objectives of this proposal are,To design and test peptidomimetics specific to VdNTLR by using the recombinant receptors, VdNTLR, VdTKR, and AmTKR in heterologous reporter system. We will design selective peptidomimetics based on the amino acid sequence motifs. We routinely perform G protein-coupled receptor assays that allow us to estimate the in vitro potency of the compound on the receptor as antagonist and agonist.To test the toxicological and biological activities of peptidomimetics on varroa mite.

Alabama predominantly has small farmers with 91 percent of the harvested cropland farm being less than 100 acres, and 76 percent of the cattle farmers having herd size of less than 50. Similar scenario exists for small ruminant producers with median meat goat herd size being 18 with average pasture acreage of 10. Same situation occurs at the national level as well with 91 percent of the family farms classified as ""small farms"" with their gross annual sales remaining under $250,000.00. The sustainability of these farms is becoming more and more challenging with the changing scenarios, such as increasing globalized market competition, growing global population and food demand, and changing climate with more extreme weather conditions. To remain sustainable, the small and medium-sized farms need to be more efficient, productive, environmentally sound, and socially appealing.Agroforestry is a sustainable land-use system that involves the intentional integration and management of trees, crops, and/or livestock in a single management unit. This system offers more economical, environmental, and social benefits compared to the sole operation of its components. Well-managed agroforestry systems provide economic viability through regular, short-term incomes from crop, non-timber forest products, livestock components, and possible wildlife hunting and tourism, and long-term incomes from tree products. Environmental benefits of agroforestry systems include, but not limited to, creation of milder microclimate, better soil conservation, nutrient recycling, carbon sequestration, cleaner water and air, and provision of other ecosystem services as compared to the system components practiced alone. The beautiful scenery of an agroforestry system adds value to the society. There are tremendous opportunities for developing agroforestry systems in the Southeast USA as most of the landowners and farmers have woodland. However, not much research has been done to explore the suitable agroforestry systems that can enhance the sustainability of small and medium-sized farms in the Southeast. Similarly, there are limited extension education opportunities available to the farmers and landowners in the rural areas on agroforestry practices.The long-term goal of this project is to promote sustainable agriculture and resilient rural communities through the development of robust, sustainable agroforestry systems that promote long-term soil productivity and generate both short- and long-term incomes from crops, livestock, and trees.

Deaths due to ExPEC infections exceed those caused by E. coli O157 by a factor of 500. ExPEC also infect chickens causing economic losses for the poultry industry. Chicken products are now suspected as vehicle sources of ExPEC to humans. The increase in numbers of immunocompromised populations coupled with multidrug-resistance among ExPECs has challenged the treatment of their infections. One difficulty in developing an effective vaccine against ExPEC is related to their antigenic diversity. Thus, a polyvalent vaccine is required. Studies to advance our understanding of the zoonotic risk of avian ExPECs and determining strategies for their reduction in chicken food-products are needed. Therefore, we propose to extend the understanding of the zoonotic mechanisms of ExPEC and develop a strategy to prevent their carriage in chickens and their presence in poultry products. Our objectives are to (i) identify the presence of different sub-pathotypes of ExPEC from chicken intestines and poultry meat and eggs from retail markets; (ii) ascertain that different subset(s) of these ExPEC are able to cause different human ExPEC infections in mice models; and (iii) develop and evaluate a Salmonella-based vaccine expressing ExPEC antigens to protect against ExPEC infections in chickens to eliminate their presence in chicken products and/or transmission through the food chain to humans. Success will provide improved human and poultry health, an economic benefit to producers and enhanced food safety.","We propose to advance the understanding of the zoonotic risk posed by ExPEC in poultry products to fill the existing gaps in our knowledge regarding ExPEC biology and transmission; moreover, our project proposes to evaluate a safe, easy to use Salmonella-based vaccine, to protect against ExPEC infections in chickens and reduce or eliminate the risk of contamination in poultry products.Our specific research objectives are to:(i) identify the presence of different sub-pathotypes of ExPEC from healthy chicken intestine (a potential reservoir of ExPEC) and poultry meat and eggs from retail markets (potential vehicles of ExPEC to humans);(ii) ascertain if subset(s) of these ExPEC are able to cause different human ExPEC infections in animal models; and(iii) develop and evaluate a Salmonella-based vaccine expressing ExPEC antigens to protect against ExPEC infections in chickens and eradicate their presence in chicken products to eliminate their transmission through the food chain to humans.Success will provide improved human and poultry health, an economic benefit to producers and will enhance food safety.","chicken, expec, vaccine, zoonotic, Avian Colibacillosis, Food-borne illnesses"
PROJECT,SAES - NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY,1008851,2016-68006-24740,Building University Market Opportunities for Small and Mid-Sized Farmers: Applied Research and Outreach to Strengthen Local Food Systems,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,469771.0,"Dunning, RE.",ACTIVE,"  Faced with a rapidly increasing world population, inequality in access to fresh and healthy foods, and food production uncertainties related to changing climatic conditions, maintaining the economic viability of the small and mid-scale farms that operate the majority of U.S. farmland is paramount. Small and mid-scale farms reporting less than $1 million in gross cash farm income account for 95% of all U.S. farms, produce one-half of the value of agricultural production, and operate 74% of US farmland. Small farms alone operate 52% of all farmland.  Preserving the land and farmer technical knowledge as critical assets depends on farm economic viability. In recent years small and mid-scale farm viability has been enhanced by consumer demand for locally-grown food from identified sources, both direct-to-consumer in the form of farmers-markets and CSA/box programs or intermediated through food service and grocers. Just as these farm operators have found profitable relationships with consumers and buyers in cities and towns, there lies a potentially profitable set of market links to another type of community: those of university and college campuses.  Campus communities comprised of students in residence, staff, administrators, and faculty, operate in ways analogous to small cities dotting landscapesacross the U.S. The potential for campus communities to act as economic drivers has been recognized for their direct and indirect impact on employment and a host of other benefits.The long-term goal of this project is increased economic vitality of small and mid- scale farmers and their communities through the development of profitable market opportunities on university campuses. The partner campuses in this project are six Minority Serving universities in North Carolina.  The general challenges to building supply chain linkages from small and mid-scale farmer/vendors and campus dining services are well known, and include inadequate farm production volume and prohibitively high costs of transportation, insurance, and compliance with food safety regulations. Yet the continued interest in locally-sourced food, and the characteristics attached to this attribute--knowledge of the grower and growing method, desire to support local businesses, minimal processing of product--remains strong. In many cases dining services, university administrators, and student local food advocates have the same goal-- broader access to locally-grown food on campus--but lack a common understanding of ""how the system works,"" and do not have an awareness of local farmer-vendors that are available toengage in campus food supply chains. Small and mid-scale farmers also often lack information on how to engage--who to talk to, and the basic prerequisites for engagement such as appropriate packaging and labeling requirements.  This project addresses in a practical and applied way the needs of campus community members and small/mid-scale farmers to understand the system, to connect and engage, and to mutually work to establish a local food presence on campus that supports local agriculture. The project has three core objectives: Establish through research activities the current status of food supply chains at six campus communities that are in areas that include limited resource farmers and through this identify the mutually beneficial entry points for bringing local foods from small and mid-scale farmers to each campus; identify and assess small and mid-scale farmer readiness to sell into these six campus communities and provide information and trainings to build farmer capacity; based on these research and extension activities, create transferable tools for application to link small and mid-scale farmers to campus community food systems across the U.S.","GOAL: The long-term goal of this project is increased economic vitality of small and mid-scale farmers and their communities through the development of profitable market opportunities for agricultural products on university campuses. Extension and applied research activities willconjointly identify opportunities to develop the campus food system, with small/mid-scale family farms playing an informed and active role in bringing locally-grown foods to campus farmers markets, retail outlets, and dining halls. The current project is based on this premise and complements two existing North Carolina grant-funded initiatives: The North Carolina Growing Together project, a 2013-2017 initiative, one aspect of which is to provide food safetyand post-harvest handling and packaging training to accessretail/wholesale markets; and the Local Food Ambassadors program, a 2015-2016 ""Train the Trainer"" initiative to support Extension-led facilitation of teams of university students, dining service staff, and university sustainability office personnel to raise awareness of local agriculture.The Building University Market Opportunities project addresses in a practical and applied way the needs of campus community members and small/mid-scale farmers to understand the system, to connect and engage, and to mutually work to establish a local food presence on campus that supports local agriculture. The partner campuses in this project are six Minority Serving universities in North Carolina, and the project has the following three core objectives:Objective 1. Establish through research activities the current status of food supply chains at six campus communities and from this analysis identify the most mutually-beneficial entry points for bringing local foods from small and mid-scale farmers to each campus.This research component seeks to understand the university food value chain by tracing product, sales, and information flows as these occur within the socioeconomic contexts of each university community, and decision-making as constrained by economic as well as sociocultural factors.Objective 2: Identify and assess near-campus farmer readiness to sell into these six university communities, provide information and trainings to build farmer capacity, and connect buyers, farmer-vendors, and campus dining staff. Project staff will collect data on campus-ready farms in the areas local to each university community, as defined by the campus geography and values, and connect these farmers to university markets. Based on the farmer assessment conducted in each university-area, we will connect farmers to existing capacity-building resources,network these farmers with campus market channels as they achieve readiness, and shepherd these nascent connections.Objective 3: Based on the above research and extension activities create transferable tools for application to the six university campuses and other other campus community food systems.Project staff will create a series of How it Works guides tailored to each partner university, with a roadmap for each market opportunity (farmers market, box program, dining service both direct-to-campus andthrough contracted wholesalers) and relevant contact information at the university and a companion document to this series to explain the process steps needed to establish relationships between all necessary partners--farmers, buyers, university administrators, students--in order to develop a robust and sustainable set of value- chain relationships that have long-term benefits for small and mid-scale farmers and their communities. This How to Engage guide will include subsections on building local food awareness in the campus community, finding and supporting farmer-vendors, understanding how campus dining services works, and organizing sustained working groups (to maintain momentum when student or staff advocates leave or dining service staff changes) to build long-term supply chain relationships between farmers and campus food systems. Practical information such as ""how to make the first contact with dining services"" and ""when to hold a meeting and with whom"" will be included.","extension, food service, local food, market channel, supply chain, university, value chain"
PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,1008863,2016-67015-25015,Using chitosan microparticles to treat metritis in lactating dairy cows,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,499887.0,"Galvao, KL, NE.",ACTIVE,"Our long-term goal is to develop solutions for improving animal health and welfare through the development of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics to treat disease in dairy cows. In this proposal, we will evaluate chitosan microparticles (CM) as an alternative treatment for metritis. Our central hypothesis is that CM is an effective treatment to eliminate pathogenic bacteria from the uterus; therefore it could be used to treat metritis in dairy cows. The following four specific aims were designed to test this hypothesis:Aim 1) Evaluation of the efficacy of intrauterine administration of CM for the treatment of metritis.Aim 2) Evaluation of the effect of CM treatment on the uterine pathogens.Aim 3) Evaluation of the effect of CM treatment on milk yield, reproductive performance, and survival.Two large commercial dairies milking ~ 4,500 cows and the IFAS dairy, which milks ~ 550 cows will be used. The PD and Co-PDs have a long-standing relationship with the dairies, have conducted similar trials at the collaborating dairies, and have gotten letters of support from the owners.Dr. Jeong has developed the technique to produce CM with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity; therefore, he will manufacture CM for use in the project.For Aim 1, dairy cows with metritis (n = 825; 275 per group) will be randomly assigned to either receive intrauterine infusion of 24 g of CM diluted in 40 ml of water every other day a total of 3 treatments, receive 6.6 mg/kg of ceftiofur (Excede&reg;, Zoetis) subcutaneously in the base of the ear at 0 and 3 days after diagnosis, or be left untreated. Metritis will be evaluated up to 12 days after treatment. Dr. Galv&atilde;o will supervise the execution of Aim 1.For Aim 2, the uterine microbiota in a subset of 60 cows from Aim 1 (20 per group) and 20 healthy cohorts will be determined by metagenomic analysis using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing will be performed at the University of Florida&#39;s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Genotyping Core facility using the Illumina MiSeq platform (http://www.biotech.ufl.edu/illumina-hiseq-and-miseq-services-now-available/). Additionally, the main uterine pathogens such as E. coli, T. pyogenes, F. necrophorum and P. melaninogenica will be quantified using real-time PCR. Dr. Jeong will supervise the execution of Aim 2.For Aim 3, the effect of CM on milk yield, reproductive performance, and survival will be evaluated in cows from Aim 1. Healthy cohorts will also be used for comparison. Dr. Galv&atilde;o will supervise the execution of Aim 3.","Aim 1) Evaluation of the efficacy of intrauterine administration of CM for the treatment of metritis. Chitosan will be used to generate CM. Dairy cows with metritis will be randomly assigned to either receive intrauterine infusion of 24 g of CM diluted in 40 ml of water for 7 days or 6.6 mg/kg of ceftiofur (Excede&reg;, Zoetis) subcutaneously in the base of the ear at 0 and 3 days after diagnosis. Metritis will be evaluated up to 14 days after treatment.Aim 2) Evaluation of the effect of CM treatment on uterine pathogens. Although we know that CM has broad-spectrum of antibiotic activity, understanding the progression of uterine microbiota, especially the shift in the pathogenic bacterial population, in control (not treated or ceftiofur-treated) cows and cows treated with CM will help us better understand the disease process and also help us refine our approach if necessary. Uterine microbiota in a subset of treated and control cows from Aim 1 will be determined by metagenomic analysis using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Additionally, the main uterine pathogens will be quantified using real-time PCR.Aim 3) Evaluation of the effect of CM treatment on milk yield, reproductive performance, and survival. An effective treatment for metritis is expected to have a positive impact on milk yield, reproductive performance, and survival of dairy cows; therefore, we will evaluate cyclicity by 50 DIM, proportion having the first artificial insemination (AI) in estrus, pregnancy per AI to first service, time to pregnancy, milk yield and survival in the first 300 DIM in treated and control cows that will be included in Aims 1. A cohort of that did not develop metritis will also be included.We are well suited to pursue this project because the Co-PD (Jeong) has developed the capability and technology to produce CM with broad-spectrum of antibiotic activity, the PD has extensive experience carrying out similar trials, the PD and collaborator have a long-standing relationship with local dairies conducting similar experiments, and PD and Co-PD demonstrated that CM has antimicrobial activity against the major uterine pathogens in cows with metritis. We envision that the results obtained during this project will benefit the dairy industry and the public at large by improving animal health, welfare and fertility, and decreasing our dependence on traditional antibiotics.","chitosan microparticles, dairy cows, treatment, Metritis"
PROJECT,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND,1008868,2016-68001-24927,Approaches to Enhancing Wellness Policy Implementation in Schools to Promote Healthy Behaviors and Prevent Obesity,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,943287.0,"Hager, ER.",ACTIVE,"The long-term goal of this integrated project is to create health promoting school environments that support healthy growth/development of children to prevent obesity. Our approach is through school-level implementation of existing Local Wellness Policies (LWPs). LWPs are federally are mandated to create healthy school environments/opportunities for healthy eating and physical activity for all students. Policy implementation may occur through diffusion (""letting it happen""), dissemination (""helping it happen""), or implementation (""making it happen""). Most school systems rely on diffusion or dissemination to achieve LWP implementation, leading to limited school-level implementation.We propose a school-level LWP implementation strategy (""making it happen"") that relies on educating/training teachers and students to be wellness champions. We will examine (1) the impact of a school-level intervention to enhance LWP implementation by training teachers to be wellness champions/providing technical assistance to support wellness team goals and activities (Wellness Champions for Change, ""WCC"") and (2) the added benefit of training students to be wellness champions/creating a student-led wellness teams trained in the tenets of health literacy (WCC-students, ""WCC-S"") on student-level outcomes (diet, physical activity, and obesity) through a randomized controlled trial. We will also examine (3) the differential impact of LWP implementation on student-level outcomes by home and school-neighborhood environment. In the final years, the WCC and WCC-S curricula will be prepared for (4) dissemination through a partnership with the Healthy Food Choices in Schools Community of Practice (eXtension). Dissemination strategies, including online continuing education for teachers and toolkits for students, will be tested for fidelity and reach.","Health promotion in schools has been a focus of pediatric obesity prevention efforts for decades, with mixed evidence on the effectiveness of specific programs or school environment changes on obesity outcomes among children.1, 2 Recent federal legislation has addressed school wellness through mandating written school system-level Local Wellness Policies (LWP).3, 4 A recent proposed rule stemming from 2010 legislation,4 emphasizes school-level LWP implementation through public updates and formal progress reports on implementation, public involvement, and triennial assessments.5 It is unknown how well schools will comply with the LWP implementation ruling or whether schools will need organized external support to be in compliance. Based on ecological theory, factors external to the school (including the home environment and the neighborhood environment surrounding the school) may moderate the impact of creating a healthy school environment on student-level health behavior change. Such relations should be empirically examined to obtain a more-complete understanding about the implementation of health promoting policies in schools and their impact on student-level health and behavior. Our interdisciplinary research team (nutritionists, health literacy experts, psychologists, statisticians, and extension educators) has a strong partnership with the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), and the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). Through this partnership and funding from the CDC, we are evaluating factors associated with system and school-level LWP implementation. Additionally, we have secured funding from the USDA to develop and pilot-test a school-based intervention, Wellness Champions for Change (WCC), to enhance school-level LWP implementation. Both projects rely on school/school system survey data, but existing funding does not support the collection of student-level data. With objective multi-level data and a strong study design based on ecological theories, the impact of LWP implementation on student-level health behaviors and moderating factors can be examined. Peers influence health behaviors of children and adolescents, in possible positive and negative directions. Recently, researchers have begun harnessing peer influence to create positive health behavior change through peer-led health education programs, which have been shown to improve health behaviors and prevent obesity (i.e.: decrease weight velocity, reduce waist circumference) in elementary and middle school-aged children.6, 7 Peer leadership should be examined in the creation of health-promoting school environments and implementation of wellness policies. Creating a student-led school wellness committee that works with the school wellness champion and wellness committee to generate student support for wellness policies and activities, would be a promising, novel strategy for improving healthy promoting environments within schools. The long-term goal of this project is to create health promoting school environments that support healthy growth and development of children in order to prevent obesity. Our approach for creating health promoting school environments involves the school-level implementation of existing LWPs. Implementation science suggests that policy implementation may occur through diffusion (""letting it happen""), dissemination (""helping it happen""), or implementation (""making it happen"").8 Since LWP were initially mandated in 2006, most school systems have relied on a diffusion or dissemination approach to LWP implementation, leading to limited implementation on the school-level.9 We propose a school-level LWP implementation strategy (""making it happen"") that relies on educating/training teachers and students to be wellness champions. Through this proposed study, we will examine the impact of a school-level intervention to enhance LWP implementation (WCC) and the added benefit of training students to be wellness champions (WCC-students, ""WCC-S"") on student-level outcomes [diet, physical activity (PA), and obesity] through a randomized controlled trial. We will also examine the differential impact of LWP implementation on student-level outcomes by home and school-neighborhood environment. In the final years of this proposed study, the WCC and WCC-S curricula will be prepared for dissemination through a partnership with the Healthy Food Choices in Schools Community of Practice (CoP), part of the eXtension network. Dissemination strategies, including on online CME training for teachers and toolkits for students, will be tested throughout Maryland for fidelity and reach.

Often invasive species can have deleterious effects on ecosystems such as reducing biodiversity and increasing fire frequency. One of the greatest challenges for resource managers is to promote the growth of native species while simultaneously suppressing the growth of invasive species. Plant functional traits have been shown to improve our understanding of several fundamental ecological processes including plant competition and community response to climate change. The potential for plant traits to guide and enhance the restoration of invaded communities has long been theorized, but few empirical tests exist.

Lack of winter soil cover increases soil organic matter and nutrient losses, resulting in decreased crop productivity and resiliency. For these reasons, larger amounts of agricultural inputs are required to maintain or increase yields. Therefore, there is a critical need to alter current cropping systems in our region by incorporating technologies to improve long-term productivity while enhancing ecosystem services. Our objectives include: i) improving management of existing cropping systems for resilience and increased productivity by innovative seeding and nutrient management of cover crops; ii) improving land use efficiency in current cropping systems through the inclusion of winter camelina and field pennycress as cover/cash crops in double or relay-cropping, and improving corn-alfalfa productivity with intercropping; and iii) increase awareness and adoption of sustainable management practices in our region. Our central hypothesis is that maintaining or increasing long-term productivity of current cropping systems can be achieved through increased adoption of the use of cover crops, double-, relay- or intercropping systems with current corn-soybean or wheat-soybean based systems. Our project seeks to renovate current cropping systems to improve sustainability of agricultural production. If the management of current cropping systems in the northern Upper Midwest and northern Great Plains is not improved, long-term productivity will likely decrease.","Improve management of existing cropping systems for resilience and increased long-term productivity by innovative seeding and nutrient management of cover crops. We hypothesize that new or modified seeding equipment will enable growers to successfully establish second crops (cover crops) in standing corn or soybean.

However, unlike human and mouse PSCs, bovine PSCs are difficult to cultivate and easy to differentiate. Tools are needed to help improve the quality of bovine PSCs especially the bovine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for downstream applications. We hypothesize that the fluorescence reporters controlled by bovine-specificgenes can serve as real-time indicators during the generation of bona fidebovine PSCs. In this proposal, we will generate these reporters controlled by bovine-specific gene regulatory elements, and validate their reporter activities in multiple PSCs and during bovine iPSC induction. The establishment of these bovine-specific fluorescence reporters will significantly facilitate the generation of pluripotent bovine PSCs suitable for genetic engineering and agricultural/biomedical applications.

PROJECT,SAES - MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,1008976,2016-67015-24898,Regulation and Regulatory Role of Wnt Signaling during Follicular Waves in Cattle,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,460000.0,"Smith, GE.",ACTIVE,"Animal agriculture is a major contributor to the overall agriculture economy in the United States. In the dairy sector, reproductive efficiency is a major contributing factor to both profitability and sustainability of dairy farms. Milk production and dairy farm productivity are negatively impacted by a less than desirable number of days when animals are not pregnant and having to remove animals from the herd who fail to become pregnant. Optimal growth and development of ovarian follicles and release of an egg (oocyte) competent for fertilization and subsequent development of an embryo/offspring to term are critical to reproductive success. Our long term goal is to increase understanding of the mechanisms that regulate growth of ovarian follicles and development of competence oocytes. Our working hypothesis is Wnt signaling pathways play a stage specific obligatory local regulatory role in control of follicle growth and are critical to oocyte competence. Project objectives are to determine differences in expression and activity of Wnt pathway components at specific stages of ovarian follicular development, specific pathway components regulating function of follicular cells cultured in vitro, and the functional role of Wnt pathway in regulating follicle growth and oocyte competence in vivo in dairy cows. Results of proposed studies will provide fundamental new information on regulation and the regulatory role of Wnt pathways in control of growth of ovarian follicles and development of competent oocytes in dairy cattle. Such information will enhance the foundation of knowledge necessary for development of new/improved tools to control follicle development and enhance dairy cow reproductive management/efficiency (fixed time insemination; superovulation and embryo transfer). Such information may also be relevant to development of new tools to reduce the rate of codominant follicles and resulting twin births which negatively impact fertility and profitability on dairy farms.","Reproductive inefficiency is a major factor limiting economic success of dairy operations. For example, conception rates in lactating dairy cows have decreased from 66% in 1951 to a less desirable level of ~35% or less today. Poor conception rates increase days open and reproductive culls. Lack of understanding of regulation of gonadal function and production of competent gametes from a molecular, cellular and whole animal perspective limits improvements in reproductive efficiency/profitability of livestock operations. Our long term goal is to increase understanding of the endocrine, cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate growth, steroidogenesis and atresia of antral follicles during follicular waves in cattle and development of oocyte competence. Our published and unpublished studies support a potential functional role for Wnt signaling in regulation of growth of ovarian follicles during follicular development and maturation. We have established temporal regulation of expression of select canonical Wnt signaling pathway components (CTNNB1, AXIN2 and DVL1) during DF selection and suggest a potential requirement of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways for regulation of basal and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced estradiol (E) production and other indices of FSH action in vitro. Our new preliminary results also support regulation of and a potential requirement for Wnt signaling in meiotic competence of oocytes.The objectives of this project are: 1) To determine the relationship between expression of specific Wnt system components, canonical and noncanonical pathway activity, and stage of differentiation, steroidogenic capacity and health status of antral bovine follicles at specific stages of a follicular wave, 2) To elucidate the relative contribution of specific Wnt ligands and the canonical and noncanonical pathways to regulation of E production and FSH action in vitro, 3) To define the contribution of Wnt signaling pathways to regulation of GC function during follicular waves in vivo in cattle, and 4) To elucidate the contribution of Wnt signaling pathways to regulation of meiotic competence and associated mechanisms.","bovine, estradiol, granulosa cell, wnt signaling, follicle wave"

This is one of the most active areas of research in mammalian immunology, but our current understanding of antigen-presentation in marine and freshwater fish is rudimentary at best. We hypothesize that fish, like mammals, have highly specialized antigen-presenting cells known as dendritic cells (DCs) that initiate and shape the adaptive immunity response to microbial pathogens. Although preliminary work from our laboratory provides strong evidence that these cells, in fact, exist, additional studies are needed to 1) validate the role of fish DCs in protective immunity against infectious disease agents; 2) understand their response to microbial cell products; and, 3) determine where, anatomically, antigen-presentation takes place. With the ability to culture these cells in vitro, we will address these questions using a variety of cellular and molecular techniques in the important aquaculture species, rainbow trout, challenged with two well known bacterial pathogens that affect aquaculture worldwide, namely, Yersinia ruckeri and Mycobacterium marinum. The results of these studies will be directly applicable to the design of more effective vaccines for the aquaculture industry thereby enhancing food production, farm efficiency and profitability, while at the same time reducing potential release of antibiotics and antimicrobials into the environment, which can be highly problematic to the human population as a whole.","Preliminary studies from our laboratory provide strong evidence that rainbow trout have specialized cells that bear many of the hallmarks of mammalian dendritic cells (DCs) including a superior ability to initiate lymphocyte (specifically, T-cell) proliferation in vitro. To validate the precise role of these cells in antigen-presentation and to further characterize their behavior and activity we plan to examine how these cells respond to well characterized signals for the activation of mammalian DCs and whether they are capable of inducing lymphocyte responses in vivo with the ultimate goal of determining where in fish antigen presentation takes place. In so doing, we will collect valuable information on the transcriptional responses of these cells to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or to infection with bacterial pathogens. Lastly, by loading trout DCs ex vivo with bacterial antigens and returning these to syngeneic and allogeneic fish we hope to demonstrate either correlates of protection (in the form of T-cell responses) or frank protection following direct pathogen challenge. In line with these goals, the specific aims of this project are to: 1) Determine the response of trout DCs to activating signals from toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and infectious disease agents; 2) Examine the trafficking of trout DCs in fish tissues, and determine where antigen-presentation is likely to take place; and, 3) Establish that antigen-loaded DCs can induce correlates of protection and/or frank protection against known bacterial pathogens of fish. In aim 1, we will investigate the phagocytic activity of trout DCs as well as their gene expression profiles in response to toll-like receptor ligands and bacterial infection. In aim 2, we will determine the homing patterns of cultured trout DCs in recipient fish and the ability of these cells to stimulate T-cell proliferation in vivo following treatment with bacterial superantigens. In aim 3, we will determine whether trout DCs can stimulate antigen-specific responses to bacterial antigens by measuring T-cell recall responses to bacterial antigens in vitro, and levels of protection of live fish challenged with bacterial pathogens after vaccination with antigen-loaded DCs.","dendritic cell, rainbow trout, Mycobacterium marinum, Yersinia ruckeri, antigen-presentation"

We seek to better understand how different actors in a supply chain drive the fair trade strategies, and how fair trade issues differ between dairy, perennial fruit, and annual vegetable production. In year one we will conduct the case studies and in year two we will elaborate research findings in conjunction with project partners - Domestic Fair Trade Association and Labor Network for Sustainability. We will extend the research findings through at least three workshops with farmers and farm workers with support from the Wisconsin Farmers Union and UW Extension School For Workers.Even though market demand for regional values-based food is relatively strong, farmers remain price takers rather than price makers in most supply chains. An indicator of success for regional food production economies is labor availability, fair working conditions and adequate income streams for all who move food from the fields to markets, particularly hired labor. Given there is a labor shortage in agriculture, what can be done to improve labor conditions and wages? ""Fair trade"" may offer strategies for securing labor for values-based supply chains, especially if there is reason to think there are multiple improvements that could be made to market relations and public policies to support regional food production.","We propose to address farm labor issues of relevance to farms that fall into the Agriculture of the Middle scale, where farmer, family and hired labor is critical to the farm&#39;s success, but also where labor is not adequately compensated in the marketplace. Even though market demand for regional values-based food is relatively strong, farmers remain price takers rather than price makers in most supply chains. This could be alleviated through strategic, negotiated supply chain partnerships, coalition-building, policy reform, and market-based fixes such as certification and strategic product marketing. We will be looking at the full playing field for farms at midscale - market signals such as fair trade certification, negotiation strategies such as member organizations and government guidelines, a full range of system drivers (farmer-led, consumer-led, supply chain-led), and different production strategies (animal, perennial and seasonal) to scope out the dynamics and flow of food systems and labor issues. Participatory research looking at these issues will allow for a complex diagnosis of the needs, challenges and opportunities to improve labor conditions necessary to strengthen regional food systems.Research objectives:Our research aims to understand domestic fair trade activities and clarify opportunities to develop a values-based labor market and income stream for regional food production. This will be done through participatory research with food system actors, by developing case studies of businesses committed to fair labor practices, and by applying the lessons learned from the global fair trade experience. AOTM businesses are organizing to address these issues and we are engaging them in the research process to ensure that the work is grounded in real-world concerns. We will look at business cases from the standpoint of farmers, aggregators, and consumers to better understand how fair trade concepts and certification impact labor relations and the structure of agriculture. We propose to conduct case studies investigating three supply chains; that of dairy, perennial fruits, and annual vegetables, since labor needs are different for these product categories. A comparative analysis of global fair trade as applied to domestic labor and market structures and national policy differences will help us learn from the global experience. We propose to use United National International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions as one labor baseline for businesses, and apply existing research on commercial fair trade initiatives for the comparative analysis.Extension objectives:This integrated project aims to facilitate collaborative, participatory research with actors engaged in domestic fair trade activities, as collaborations for fair trade or through fair trade certification arrangements. We aspire to facilitate robust social networks among the research team and collaborators and to bring the labor conversation into existing and potential social networks. Farmer-worker meetings are a natural outgrowth of the participatory research relationships and will provide a rich context to shape the case studies and better understand the ramification of global research findings in a domestic context.Long-range improvement in and sustainability of US agriculture and food systems:This project will elevate the issue of just workforce development for midscale agriculture. We expect it will demonstrate the opportunities and challenges to building a workforce necessary for a values-based regional food system. We propose to link global research and governance to domestic needs in such a way that stimulates farmer -worker discussions. We think these discussions will lead to innovative approaches to scaling up resilient regional food systems. Previous research supports the value of mid-scale farms in food supply chains (Stevens and Pirog 2008). The proposed work will address one of the primary limitations to mid-scale business development in food systems.","certification, fair trade, Labor, Midscale farms"

A significant gap in knowledge is the comprehensive understanding of the metabolic networks used by MAP to regulate iron under a variety of environmental conditions. Iron-binding regulatory and regulated effector proteins are well established as key virulence determinants and have been targeted as vaccines for multiple pathogens. Our preliminary work on MAP iron regulation has led to multiple discoveries, the most significant of which is the in-vivo identification of a fur-like gene, located on the MAP-specific genomic island, designated LSP15. The function of Fur in iron regulation is well established in Gram-negative bacteria. However, environmental cues for MAP to deploy Fur and how this novel gene interacts with the essential transcription factor (MAP2827c or IdeR) are unknown. Our studies have further shown that MAP likely employs alternate iron regulatory pathways, unlike other pathogenic mycobacteria. We hypothesize that MAP3773c (fur) that was acquired by horizontal gene transfer encodes a functional protein for sensing extracellular signals and maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis.

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative agent of JD, is fastidious often requiring eight to sixteen weeks to produce colonies in culture - a major hurdle in the diagnosis and therefore in implementation of optimal JD control measures.A significant gap in knowledge is the comprehensive understanding of the metabolic networks used by MAP to regulate iron under a variety of environmental conditions. Iron-binding regulatory and regulated effector proteins are well established as key virulence determinants and have been targeted as vaccines for multiple pathogens. Our preliminary work on MAP iron regulation has led to multiple discoveries, the most significant of which is the identification of in-vivo upregulation of a fur-like gene, located on the MAP-specific genomic island, designated LSP15. The function of Fur in iron regulation is well established in Gram-negative bacteria. However, environmental cues for MAP to deploy Fur and how this novel gene interacts with the essential transcription factor (MAP2827c or IdeR) are unknown. Our studies show that MAP employs a sophisticated repertoire of inter-connected proteins in response to environmental stress. Identification of iron sparing responses as well as the upregulation of Fur in-vivo suggests that alternate regulatory pathways are likely employed by MAP, unlike other pathogenic mycobacteria. Thus a deeper analysis on metabolic networks deployed by MAP is warranted to understand how iron is regulated in MAP in low and high iron environments. These studies are expected to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of Johne&#39;s disease advancing our understanding of a key MAP virulence determinant. Our long-term goal is to understand the functional genome of MAP and its metabolic networks in order to sharpen our understanding of MAP virulence and to help devise optimal detection and vaccine strategies for JD.Hypothesis: MAP3773c (fur) that was acquired by horizontal gene transfer encodes a functional protein for sensing extracellular signals and maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis.

We here hypothesize that Fur (MAP3773c) is a functional protein and plays a significant role to overcome the iron-induced stress response, especially under intracellular conditions. We will create an in-frame deletion in MAP3773c and study the interactions between Fur regulated proteins via global transcriptional analysis compared to a complemented and the parent strain, in-vitro, ex-vivo, and in-vivo. These studies will provide strong scientific foundations on the role of fur (MAP3773c) and its iron-responsive regulon in MAP.Specific Aim 2: Functionally characterize iron-induced proteomes of MAP (DMAP3773c, Complemented DMAP3773c, and K-10) via high throughput iTRAQ analysis. We will test the working hypothesis that Fur regulon interacts with the IdeR regulated proteins. We propose to characterize this response using the kinetics of iron induced (secreted and cell-associated) protein expression in-vitro with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) based approaches in the fur mutant, and complemented and wild-type strains. We will then compare the transcript-proteome data for correlation between the two regulons to elucidate gene regulation in MAP.","fur, iron, paratuberculosis, virulence, Iron regulation, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis"
PROJECT,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT RIV,1009063,2016-67011-25097,Potential density- and dose-dependent factors in the use of aggregation pheromones by cerambycid beetles.,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,75758.0,"Collignon, RO, MA.",ACTIVE,"Longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) are woodboring insects that infest trees and woody plants, causing serious direct damage and sometimes killing trees, and indirect damage through pathogen transmission. Invasive longhorn beetle species can be major threats to U.S. forests and natural resources. Longhorn beetles also threaten agricultural crops and orchards - including some non-woody crops like soybean, sunflower, and hops - and are thus a threat to U.S. food security and agricultural exports. Pheromones offer a potential means to detect invasive species as rapidly as possible after introduction, and possibly to control both invasive and native pest longhorn beetle species. Longhorn beetles have major potential to be invasive because their larvae can be present within wooden materials being shipped from overseas and remain undetected by conventional inspections. Pheromone-based monitoring and control tactics also offer benefits in being environmentally safe, with essentially non-target effects.A few longhorn beetle pheromones have been identified, with most being male-produced pheromones that attract both sexes. However, understanding of pheromone use in the family is rudimentary, limiting our ability to develop effective lures for management purposes. Many other pest and invasive beetle species, such as Colorado potato beetle and many stored product pest species, also use male-produced pheromones and there are parallels in pheromone usage between longhorn beetles and these other species. For these other beetle species, density- and dose-dependent effects are common, but such factors have not been explored for longhorn beetles. The proposed research will test three factors potentially influencing pheromone usage by these species:1) The influence of host plant material on pheromone production, which will be accomplished by sampling for pheromone production of males in the presence or absence of host material; this will inform us of whether inclusion of host plant material is an important factor for pheromone production, potentially expediting pheromone identification of emergent pests or invasive species - a non-trivial undertaking - for use in pheromone-based control or management tactics; 2) The influence of male density on pheromone production, by sampling for pheromone production of males in the presence or absence of other males. As with Objective 1, this has the potential to expedite pheromone identification for control purposes for emergent pest species; 3) The influence of pheromone release rate on response by members of the same species, by testing a range of pheromone release rates from pheromone-baited traps. This will tell us if we can develop more effective traps simply by increasing the release rate of a pest&#39;s pheromone, or if too high a release rate may be inhibitory and result in less effective trapping. As well as informing how we utilize pheromone-based detection and management for invasive and pest longhorn beetle species, this research will be useful in applying similar approaches for biodiversity monitoring of native longhorn beetles. Non-pest, native longhorn beetles are important to forest ecosystems as primary decomposers of woody material and by culling weak, sickly, and stressed trees. Optimized pheromone-based monitoring of these communities of beetles would offer us a useful means to monitor biodiversity of our native longhorn beetle communities and as part of broader assessments of forest health.Overall, my results will aid in the development of pheromone-based tools for detection and management of invasive and pest longhorn beetles, by identifying factors that allow for more rapid pheromone identification, and by increasing efficacy of such tactics by determining optimal pheromone release rates. The results of this research will be disseminated to other researchers in the field of invasive species management and to regulatory agencies via publication of peer-reviewed articles and by presentations at national and international conferences. The general public can also access results of the research via Twitter and ResearchGate social media. Results from the research will also be used by the primary researcher in outreach events to illustrate concepts in ecology, invasive species management, and the scientific process, as well as to stimulate interest in protecting our native forests from biological invasion. Overall, this project specifically addresses the Plant Health and Production and Plant Products program area of USDA NIFA. It will conceptually bring together disparate literature on species that use aggregation pheromones, with broad implications for pheromone-based detection and management of a wide variety of pest and invasive species. ","The goal of the proposed research is to determine how male-produced pheromones (MPPs) are utilized by cerambycid beetles, by identifying specific factors that influence pheromone production and response. More broadly, our goal is to gain a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary reasons why some insects use sex pheromones that attract only one sex, whereas other species use aggregation pheromones that attract both sexes.Our project goal will be addressed by the following objectives: 1) Determine whether the presence of host plant material affects (increases) pheromone emission by males; 2) Determine whether the presence of conspecific males influences pheromone emission by males (density-dependent effects); 3) Determine whether pheromone release rate affects response by conspecifics of both sexes (dose-dependent effects). Answering these questions will be beneficial in: A) Developing biologically relevant and effective semiochemical-based management tools for cerambycids, and also; B) Identifying possible general patterns in MPP use by other species of beetles that utilize this type of pheromone, including many species of economic importance such as Colorado potato beetle and Tribolium species. This research thus has the potential to have a broad impact on how we use semiochemically-based management tools against a wide range of MPP-utilizing species. For cerambycids, a number of volatile pheromones have been identified to date, including both MPPs and female-produced sex pheromones. Currently, it is not clear why some species of cerambycids utilize MPPs as opposed to female-produced pheromones. MPPs are classified as aggregation pheromones because they attract both sexes, but their functional role may be that of sex pheromones if females are attracted to potential mates and males exploit the signals of other calling males. There are parallels in how MPPs are used between MPP-cerambycid species and other MPP-beetle species: congeneric species often share pheromone components, host plant volatiles have synergistic or additive effects with the pheromones, and the presence of host material stimulates pheromone production. Density- and dose-dependent effects on pheromone usage have not been investigated for cerambycids, although these effects have been seen in some other MPP-beetle taxa. The proposed research will test factors that may affect the production of and response to MPPs in cerambycids, as a first step towards a better understanding of the ecological roles of these signals, allowing for development of more efficacious semiochemical-based management for cerambycids and potentially other MPP-utilizing pest beetle species.","cerambycidae, invasive species, pest management, woodboring insects, aggregation pheromones"

Dairy fertility is a complex phenotype affected by many factors that include nutrition, management, environment and genetics. For the past 50 years, dairy production continued to increase but fertility experienced severe declines. This decreasing trend of reproduction performance has been reversed during the last decade since fertility was considered in selection. The big data in the national dairy genomics database provide the highest power to dissect genetic effects of fertility traits and an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the speed to increase dairy fertility. The overall goal of this project is to discover causal/tightly linked genetic variants and apply the genomic discoveries to improve dairy fertility. The specific aims are to 1) identify genomic regions associated with fertility by using sequence-based transmission ratio distortion test and genome-wide association analyses; and 2) identify and apply causal/tightly linked genomic variants and regions to the development of optimal strategies for genomic selection to improve dairy fertility. The expect outcomes include increase in dairyreproductive performance, a breakthrough understandingin the genetic mechanism of dairyfertility-related traits, and decreased cost of genotyping in dairy genomic evaluation. Through USDA-ARS Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory, research results will be disseminated to dairy farmers and the industry through new SNP chips for dairy genomic evaluation, novel haplotype-based genomic selection methods for fertility traits, and routine genomic evaluations of fertility traits along with the animals carrying mutations that have severe effects on fertility.

PROJECT,"PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY, THE",1009145,2016-67003-24966,Nitrite Ammonification in Manures and Soils Under Adaptive Management for Climate Change,National Institute of Food and Agriculture,NIFA Non Formula,540000.0,"Bruns, MA, VI.",ACTIVE,"Agriculture accounts for 75-80% of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the U.S. Denitrification in fertilized soils and during animal waste handling results in about 60% and 30% of N2O emissions, respectively. This proposal aims to gain knowledge of how soils and manures can be managed to counteract denitrification and to promote a bacterial process known as nitrite ammonification, the end product of which (ammonium) is not lost directly to the atmosphere. We hypothesize that nitrite ammonification occurs to a significant extent in soils managed using no-till practices and labile carbon amendments, either with animal or green manures. Particularly in combination, these practices increase labile soil carbon content and improve soil water-holding capacity, and they are being adopted by farmers in response to more variable and extreme weather resulting from climate change. Innovative soil management, such as manure injection currently evaluated at Penn State&#39;s Sustainable Dairy Cropping Systems project, minimizes disturbance during carbon enrichment and needs to be assessed for its effect on denitrification and nitrite ammonification. Moreover, manure storage and handling practices favoring nitrite ammonification over denitrification need to be identified. Specific objectives of this proposal are to 1) measure bacterial groups and labile carbon substrates in manures from dairies of varying size and manure handling systems; 2) measure GHGs and temporal and spatial changes in nitrite ammonification and denitrification in no-till soils of the Sustainable Dairy Cropping Systems project; 3) conduct soil mesocosm studies to determine relationships between substrates, physicochemical conditions, microbial processes, and GHGs to understand conditions favoring nitrite ammonification over denitrification.","The overarching goal of this project is identify manure and soil management practices that help reduce agriculture&#39;s contributions to greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly nitrous oxide (N2O). Currently agriculture contributes 75-80% of anthropogenic N2O emissions in the United States, with fertilized soils and livestock wastes contributing about 60% and 30% of that total. Efforts to reduce these emissions have high priority because the global warming potential of N2O is nearly 300 times that of CO2. Incomplete denitrification is considered to be the major source of N2O in agriculture, with nitrification a secondary contributor. No-till soils are particularly susceptible to denitrification losses of N2O when soils are recently fertilized and wet. It is paradoxical, therefore, that higher N2O emissions occur when farmers apply conservation tillage practices intended to make soils more resilient to climate change. Denitrification, however, is not the only nitrate (NO3-) conversion pathway that bacteria carry out under O2-depleted conditions. Some bacteria can instead reduce NO3- and/or nitrite (NO2-) to ammonium (NH4+) without N2O as an intermediate. This process, known either as nitrate/nitrite ammonification (NA) or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), results in an end product (NH4+) that is retained in the soil rather than lost to the atmosphere. Recent advances in molecular detection of nitrate/nitrite-ammonifying (NA) bacteria indicate their surprisingly high genetic diversity and widespread distribution in the environment. Indeed, many enteric bacteria present in animal wastes (e.g., E. coli) are known to be nitrate/nitrite ammonifiers. In this proposal, we aim to address the question, ""Can we use NA to avoid the tradeoff of higher N2O emissions from systems employing soil, water, and nutrient conservation practices?""The main goals of this proposal are to 1) obtain basic knowledge about NA bacteria in manures and soils; 2) identify conditions and management practices affecting NA activity in C-enriched soils; and 3) evaluate net global warming potentials of NA-conducive practices. Specifically, this proposal focuses on NA bacterial groups and their responses to chemical status and physical conditions in dairy wastes and field soils at Pennsylvania State University&#39;s Sustainable Dairy Cropping System project (SDCS) funded by NESARE (Northeast Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education) program. The SDCS is one of the greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring sites participating in the USDA-CAP network, Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Dairy Production Systems in the Great Lakes Region (WI, NY, and PA). At the SDCS, no-till practices are combined with low-disturbance carbon (C) amendment of soils using dairy wastes and/or perennials or cover crops, which are important sources of organic matter in climate-adaptive farming.Specific objectives of this project are to:1) Characterize NA bacteria in manures from diverse dairies. Measure the abundance and characterize groups of nitrate/nitrite ammonifiers and denitrifiers in manures from the SDCS and other private dairies which employ varied manure storage and handling procedures. Assess relationships between bacterial groups and manure composition, pH, redox, age, and storage practices. Determine conditions enabling NA activity in laboratory mesocosms using varying combinations of electron donors and electron acceptors and measure relative activities of nitrate-nitrite ammonifiers and denitrifiers.2) Measure soil properties and gas fluxes (N2O, CH4, NH3, CO2) in SDSC. Carry out spatially and temporally intensive sampling of soil properties (including pH and redox) and GHG fluxes from SDSC plots (comparing broadcast- and injected manure, with and without cover crops), and link these measurements to expression levels of bacterial genes for key N transformations in relation to surface residues and manure injection sites.3) Assess NA and denitrification activities in soil mesocosms under varied conditions. Conduct controlled studies with diverse soils amended with manures, stable-isotope labeled nitrate, and specific organic substrates in laboratory mesocosms. These experiments will be used to evaluate application methods and determine relationships between gas fluxes, C additions, and incubation conditions.","cropping systems, denitrification, greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, no-till, DNRA"

Many of the benefits of manure to soil are what make a soil ""resilient"" to changes in resource availability and may enhance cropping systems resilience to stressors associated with climate change.We propose to investigate the potential of manure amendments to shape climate-smart microbial communities that both reduce GHG emissions and build resilience of soil ecosystem services to stress. Better understanding of these dynamics, increased with new knowledge of the microbial communities driving these processes, is sorely needed to better predict how manure additions will affect GHG fluxes and to help design sustainable integrated dairy-forage cropping systems with high resilience to climate change. We propose to investigate the potential of manure amendments to shape climate-smart microbial communities that both reduce GHG emissions and build resilience of soil ecosystem services to stress. Our central hypothesis is that dairy manure amendments enhance microbially-mediated processes beneficial to build climate-smart forage cropping systems. Changes expected with manure application includeincreased soil organic carbon and microbial biomass/diversity; reduced GHG emissions and increases in GHG consumption, increased water and nitrogen retention and use efficiency and improved resilience to drought.Specific objectives include to:i)determinehow long-term manure application changes soil microbial and physicochemical properties in forage cropping systems; ii)determine optimal rate of manure application in which microbial functions and crop yields are maintained while soil GHG emissions are decreased; and iii) determine if soils with different histories of manure application have increased resistance/resilience to climate change perturbation, specifically drought.The magnitude of these differences will be linked to shifts in functional status of the microbial community as evidenced by changes in phylogeny and function, as well as in changes in the soil physicochemical environment.Better understanding of these dynamics, increased with new knowledge of the microbial communities driving these processes, is sorely needed to better predict how manure additions will affect GHG fluxes and to help design sustainable integrated dairy-forage cropping systems with high resilience to climate change.A result of our research will beidentification ofpractices of manure application to soils that are most likely to lead to climate resilient productivity and have the greatest capacity to sequester carbon or mitigate GHG fluxes.","Specific goalsinclude to:i)determinehow long-term manure application changes soil microbial and physicochemical properties in forage cropping systems; ii)determine optimal rate of manure application in which microbial functions and crop yields are maintained while soil GHG emissions are decreased; and iii) determine if soils with different histories of manure application have increased resistance/resilience to climate change perturbation, specifically drought.",GHG manure soil organic matter nutrient-cycling microbial biodiveristy ecosystem function climate

To date, 11,845 positive accessions of PEDV have been identifiedin 33 states (USDA-APHIS) (Figure 1a). Likewise, 742 positive accessions of PDCoV have beenidentified in 19 states (USDA-APHIS) (Figure 1b). The annual impact to the United States fromSECDs is estimated to be $900 million to $8 billion due to nearly 100% death loss in infectedpiglets. Significant losses of productivity occur in growing animals, in addition to increased fixedcapital costs and negative impacts on trade (Paarlberg, 2014). The pork industry has concededthat the USDA alone cannot be expected to protect the industry from emerging diseases and thatenhanced industry and state-level response coordination is critical to control the spread of PEDVand other swine enteric coronavirus diseases (SECD) throughout the United States.Effective internal and external biosecurity practices are the best way to prevent outbreaks andcontrol the spread of SECDs, such as PEDV. Extensive PEDV-related research funded by theNational Pork Board and other organizations since the arrival of PEDV in the U.S. has yieldedevidence-based techniques for decontamination and control of PEDV and other swine entericviruses at various critical control points (CCPs) within the farm system. However, a substantial gapexists in understanding how to holistically integrate these recommendations to most effectivelydecontaminate and remediate a farm prior to repopulation to prevent subsequent outbreaks, asthis has not previously been addressed with best practices in a uniform manner. Additionally, aspart of the Federal Order issued on June 5, 2014, SECD positive premises are required todevelop and implement a herd management plan with their veterinarian. However, specificrecommendations were not issued and were left to the producer and herd veterinarian todevelop. This leaves a significant knowledge gap between discovery and implementation ofevidenced-based on-farm practices and the efficacy and economic impact of such practices.Finally, the inherent need for focusing swine disease control efforts on prevention rather thanremediation provides a strong incentive for increased information sharing among producers in thepork industry that includes economic incentives for implementing farm-level biosecurity practices.Such knowledge would provide translational benefits that would be applicable to a wide rangeof infectious agents, foreign or domestic.Our goals in this application are to: 1) verify the effectiveness offarm-level implementation of practices for decontamination andremediation following a PEDV outbreak and implementation ofbiosecurity practices following repopulation or achievement ofdisease-free status, and 2) create a culture of ""vigilantpreparedness and prevention"" among swine producers to minimize impacts of future diseaseoutbreaks. Research has illustrated that SECDs have similar risk factors, including transmissibilityand how they respond to decontamination and control strategies; therefore, we believe usingPEDV as a model for determining the effectiveness of a holistic farm-level remediation approachfor SECDs is defensible. Based upon the outcomes of many independent studies on PEDVdecontamination and prevention strategies, our central hypothesis is that a holistic, multi-facetedapproach to decontamination of PEDV-positive farms with producer-led promotion of farm-levelbiosecurity planning will positively impact the control of PEDV and other SEDCs throughout theU.S.","Our goals in this application are to:1) verify the effectiveness offarm-level implementation of practices for decontamination andremediation following a PEDV outbreak and implementation ofbiosecurity practices following repopulation or achievement ofdisease-free status.2) create a culture of ""vigilantpreparedness and prevention"" among swine producers to minimize impacts of future diseaseoutbreaks.Objectives of the project include:","PEDV, biosecurity, enteric diseases, farm decontamination, farm remediation, producer-led outreach"

The expected audience are key stakeholders from academia, such as faculty from environmental and agricultural programs across the island; public service leaders at the local level, such as mayors, and also state representatives, such as government agency leaders of the island; leaders from a variety of farmer associations, community leaders from other non-governmental organizations, and the general public. This conference occurs while Puerto Rico has been experimented climate variability in terms of alternated extreme events of precipitation in some areas and droughts events in other areas that have driven potable water rationing for public supply. Because non-traditional water use for agriculture is a strategy barely used in Puerto Rico, this conference will provide the first opportunity to disseminate the potential uses as an alternative during drastic drought events, such as in current days. In addition, the conference will supports fundamental research to increase the understanding of the phenomena of community risks perceptions and concerns on wastewater use for agriculture as baseline information for stakeholders and community. To address the latter, the PI and Co-PI will collect cross-sectional data among willing participants in the audience to assess their perceptions and concerns of wastewater reuse for agriculture at the beginning of the conference. This ensures that the sample is ""pre-treatment"" as no other activity or learning processes has occurred at the conference yet. The procedures will follow all Institutional Review Board regulations according the Ana G. M&eacute;ndez System Compliance office. The researchers will do everything to protect privacy and confidentiality of the participants during both the poll and the final satisfaction assessment. First, the researchers will protect anonymity because, the instruments to be used will not collect any identifying information of individual subjects. Second, to maintain confidentiality, only the PI of the project and the Co-PI will have access to the filled form by participants. This is a strategy that has been used successfully by the School of Environmental Affairs previously. At the end of the conference, we will get feedback from all attendees utilizing a satisfaction assessment utilizing the same methods to preserve anonymity. The assessment will invite the audience to share what they liked and disliked about the event, as well as the final considerations related to the content discussed in the conference. The participants will have the opportunity and the satisfaction to be considered as an important key player in society decisions. The results will produce local baseline information which can in turn provide some guidance on how to approach the challenges faced when implementing wastewater reuse in communities. The information generated can be used for stakeholder&#39;s decision making on educational and promotional programs as well agriculture projects that reuse water with treatment. Results will be submitted to the agency, published in the journal Perspectivas en Asuntos Ambientales, disseminated to the collaborators, and published on the School&#39;s webpage.
